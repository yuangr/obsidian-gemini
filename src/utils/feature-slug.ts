/**
 * The slug contract shared by the vault-backed features whose user-supplied
 * identifier becomes a file basename inside the plugin state folder — hooks,
 * scheduled tasks, and skills (#1485).
 *
 * One predicate, two contracts: hooks and tasks accept `2fa-cleanup`-shaped
 * slugs (leading digit is fine); skills must start with a letter per the
 * agentskills.io spec. The divergence is this module's parameter, not a
 * second regex — the leading-character rule is the only difference, so the
 * rest of the contract (lowercase ASCII, hyphens as separators, 1–64 chars,
 * no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens, no path separators or `..`)
 * cannot drift between the three call sites again.
 *
 * Kept a leaf module: services and UI import it; nothing may import back
 * (the #1155 acyclic-graph rule).
 *
 * Scope note: `sanitizeKeySegment` in `src/mcp/mcp-oauth-provider.ts` is
 * deliberately NOT routed through here — it sanitizes secret-storage keys
 * with a deliberate hash fallback, a different job from validating a
 * file-bound identifier.
