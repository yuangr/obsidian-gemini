/**
 * Soft turn budget for the agent tool-execution loop.
 *
 * Layers a *soft* budget on top of the loop's existing hard iteration cap
 * (`AgentLoopOptions.maxIterations`). Where the hard cap is a dumb stop — the
 * run just dies with `exhausted: true` the moment it's hit — this helper adds
 * two behaviours the paper "More with Less: An Empirical Study of Turn-Control
 * Strategies for Efficient Coding Agents" (arXiv 2510.16786) found beat a fixed
 * cap by 12–24%:
 *
 *  1. **Reminder** — when only a few turns remain, the loop injects an
 *     "ENVIRONMENT REMINDER: you have N turns left" line so the model can wrap
 *     up instead of being cut off mid-thought.
 *  2. **One-shot extension** — when the budget is spent but the model still
 *     wants to call tools (i.e. it hasn't produced a final answer), the budget
 *     grants a single extra allotment so a task that needs "just a couple more"
 *     turns isn't killed at the cap. A second expiry falls through to the
 *     hard-stop `exhausted` path.
 *
 * This class owns only the *bookkeeping*: it does not know about the loop, the
 * model, or history. The loop drives it (`isExhausted`, `shouldRemind`,
 * `grantExtension`) and performs the actual injection.
 *
 * An *unlimited* budget (constructed from `undefined`) is inert: it never
 * reminds, never exhausts, and never extends — matching the loop's "no cap"
 * default for callers that pass no `maxIterations`.
