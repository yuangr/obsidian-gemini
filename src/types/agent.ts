/**
 * Per-turn system-prompt fields that must stay byte-stable across the
 * initial model call AND every follow-up/retry within the same user turn.
 *
 * These are set once when the user sends a message (in `agent-view-send.ts`)
 * and threaded through `AgentLoopOptions` so the system prompt rebuilt on
 * each model call inside the loop is byte-identical to the initial one.
 *
 * Two reasons this matters:
 *  1. Correctness — `perTurnContext` carries the rendered content of files
 *     dragged or @-mentioned into the chat. Dropping it on follow-ups means
 *     the model can't reference that content after a tool call, so it tends
 *     to re-read the same files via tools. `projectInstructions` /
 *     `projectSkills` similarly disappear, so project-scoped behavior
 *     degrades the moment a tool fires.
 *  2. Cache stability — Gemini's implicit prefix cache keys on the exact
 *     system-prompt bytes. Rebuilding without these fields between the
 *     initial call and the follow-up changes the prefix and forces a
 *     cache miss on every follow-up in a long tool chain.
 *
 * Lives in this shared types module (rather than the UI agent-view module)
 * so the UI-agnostic `AgentLoop` can depend on the type without crossing
 * the agent → UI boundary.
