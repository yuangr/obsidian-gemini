 * DESTRUCTIVE raises confirmation in every preset and moves the tool into the
 * correct execution-sort band behind native writes). A lying server only
 * hurts itself. `readOnlyHint` is deliberately NOT honored: promoting a tool
 * to READ on a server's say-so would auto-approve it under Cautious/Edit mode
 * — the exact untrusted-hint decision the MCP spec warns against.
 *
 * Everything else — absent annotations, unknown shapes, false hints — maps to
 * EXTERNAL, preserving the pre-#1449 behavior as the default. There is no
 * under-gating path: the mapper never returns a band more permissive than
 * EXTERNAL.
