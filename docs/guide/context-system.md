## Overview

### What is Context?

Context in Gemini Scribe refers to files from your vault that the AI agent can access and reference during conversations. Unlike previous versions that automatically traversed linked notes, v4.0+ uses an **explicit, session-based approach** where you manually select which files to include.

### Key Features

- **Session-Based**: Context files persist for the entire session
- **Manual Control**: You choose exactly which files to include
- **@ Mentions**: Quick file selection via @ symbol (supports text and binary files)
- **Unified File Shelf**: All context files, folders, and attachments displayed in a single horizontal strip
- **Tool Integration**: Agent can read additional files on demand
- **AGENTS.md**: Vault-wide context initialization

### Why This Approach?

The new context system provides:

- **Clarity**: You know exactly what the AI can see
- **Performance**: No automatic traversal means faster responses
- **Flexibility**: Add or remove context as needed during conversation
- **Control**: Precise management of what information the AI accesses

## How Context Works

### Context vs. Tool Access

**Context Files** (Always Available):

- Added via @ mentions, drag-and-drop, or the file selection modal
- Displayed in the unified file shelf above the input area
- Automatically included with every message
- Persist throughout the session
- Ideal for reference material you'll use repeatedly

**Tool-Based File Access** (On-Demand):

- Agent uses `read_file` tool when needed
- Not automatically included with messages
- Ideal for files the agent discovers during conversation
- More flexible but requires agent initiative

### AGENTS.md - Vault Context

AGENTS.md is a special file that provides the agent with an overview of your entire vault structure:

**What it contains:**

- Vault folder structure
- File organization patterns
- Key notes and their purposes
- Naming conventions
- Tags and categories in use

**How to create it:**

1. Open Agent Chat
2. Click "Initialize vault context" button
3. Agent analyzes your vault and creates AGENTS.md
4. Update periodically as your vault evolves

**Benefits:**

- Agent understands your vault organization
- Better file discovery and suggestions
- More relevant tool usage
- Improved understanding of relationships

## Adding Context Files

### Method 1: @ Mentions (Recommended)

The fastest way to add context files:

1. Type `@` in the chat input
2. A file picker appears showing text files, Gemini-supported binary files (images, PDFs, audio, video), and folders
3. Start typing the file name
4. Select from the filtered list
5. File appears in the shelf above the input
6. The file is now persistent context for the session

Typing `@` always opens the picker (focus moves to its search box). To keep a literal `@` in your message instead of picking a file, press **Esc** to dismiss the picker — the `@` you already typed stays in the input.

**Example:**

```text
User: @Project Plan Can you help me...
[File appears in the shelf as "Project Plan.md"]
[File becomes persistent context for session]
```

### Method 2: File Selection Modal

For adding, reviewing, or removing multiple files at once:

1. Click the file icon in the session header
2. An Obsidian-style search modal opens — files already in context appear pre-checked
3. Type to filter; the modal uses Obsidian's built-in fuzzy search to rank results
4. Press **Enter** (or click) to toggle a file or folder on/off
5. Press **Esc** to confirm and close — additions and removals are applied together

**Folder support:**

Folders appear alongside files in the list (identified by a folder icon and a trailing `/`). Selecting a folder toggles all the text files inside it at once (markdown plus other text formats like `.canvas`, `.base`, `.json`). The check icon reflects the folder's state:

- **☑ Filled** — all files in the folder are selected
- **☐ Partial** (minus) — some files selected
- **☐ Empty** — no files selected

Unchecking a folder (or individual file) that was already in context **removes** it from context when you close the modal.

**Search tips:**

- **Fuzzy matching**: type a few characters and matching files bubble up — `proj` matches "Project-Overview.md", "proj-notes.md"
- **Natural sort**: numbers in file names sort numerically — `file8`, `file9`, `file10`, `file11`
- **Keyboard**:
  - **Enter** — toggle the highlighted item's selection
  - **Esc** — confirm all changes and close

### Method 3: Drag and Drop

Drag files from the file explorer directly into the chat.

### What Happens When You Add Context

1. **File is Read**: Content is loaded from your vault
2. **Added to Session**: File persists as context
3. **Included in Messages**: Content sent with every message
4. **Visible in Shelf**: File appears in the unified shelf above the input area with a pin badge
5. **Stays Active**: Remains until you remove it or end session
6. **Folder Re-expansion**: Folders are re-expanded each turn, so newly created files inside a folder are automatically included

## Managing Context

### Viewing Current Context

Active context files are displayed in the **unified file shelf** — a horizontal strip above the input area:

- Text files and folders show a pin badge
- Binary attachments (images, PDFs, audio, video) show appropriate icons
- Click any item to open the file in Obsidian
- Use **Arrow Left/Right** to navigate between items with the keyboard

### Removing Context Files

To remove a file from context:

1. Click the **×** button on the shelf item, or
2. Press **Delete** or **Backspace** when the item is focused on the shelf, or
3. Open the file selection modal, uncheck the file (or folder), and press **Esc**

### Context Limits

**Technical Limits:**

- Maximum token limit per request (~1M tokens for current Gemini models)
- Large files count against this limit
- Agent may not see all content if limit exceeded

**Practical Recommendations:**

- **1-5 files**: Ideal for most conversations
- **5-10 files**: Works well for research projects
- **10+ files**: May exceed token limits with large files

**File Size Considerations:**

- Small notes (<5KB): Minimal impact
- Medium notes (5-50KB): Good for context
- Large notes (>50KB): Use sparingly
- Very large (>100KB): Consider summarizing first

### Session Persistence

Context files persist:

- ✅ Throughout the current session
- ✅ Across Obsidian restarts, when the "Session History" setting is enabled (off by default — see [Settings Reference](/reference/settings))
- ✅ When loading saved sessions
- ❌ When creating a new session

To reuse context:

- Load a saved session with existing context
- Or re-add files to new sessions

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Minimal, Expand as Needed

```markdown
❌ Add 20 files immediately
✅ Start with 2-3 most relevant files
✅ Add more if agent needs additional information
```

### 2. Use Relevant, Focused Files

**Good Context:**

- Project overview documents
- Reference materials for current task
- Files with key terminology or concepts
- Documents you'll reference repeatedly

**Poor Context:**

- Random notes not related to conversation
- Very large files (use summaries instead)
- Duplicate information across files
- Rarely-referenced materials

### 3. Leverage AGENTS.md

Before adding lots of context files:

1. Ensure AGENTS.md is current
2. Let agent use tools to discover files
3. Only add files you know you'll reference repeatedly

### 4. Name Files Clearly

The @ mention system works by file name:

- Use descriptive file names
- Avoid generic names like "Notes.md"
- Consider prefixes for organization
- Examples: "Project-Alpha-Overview.md", "Meeting-2024-Q1.md"

### 5. Update Context During Conversation

Context isn't static:

```
User: @Design Doc Let's review the design
[Discuss design]

User: Now I want to implement. Let me add the code structure
      @Code Structure @API Design
[Add new context files as conversation evolves]
```

### 6. Remove Unused Context

If a file is no longer relevant:

- Remove it to save token budget
- Keeps context focused and relevant
- Improves response quality

## Advanced Usage

### Use Case: Research Project

**Setup:**

```
Context Files:
1. Research Question.md - Your main question
2. Literature Review.md - Key papers and findings
3. Methodology.md - Approach and methods
```

**Workflow:**

1. Agent has constant access to research foundation
2. Can compare new findings to literature review
3. Maintains consistency with methodology
4. Add new sources as you discover them

### Use Case: Software Project

**Setup:**

```
Context Files:
1. README.md - Project overview
2. ARCHITECTURE.md - System design
3. API-Spec.md - Interface definitions
```

**Workflow:**

1. Agent understands project structure
2. Suggests code that fits architecture
3. Follows API specifications
4. Can create files in proper locations

### Use Case: Writing Project

**Setup:**

```
Context Files:
1. Character Profiles.md - Main characters
2. World Building.md - Setting details
3. Plot Outline.md - Story structure
```

**Workflow:**

1. Maintains character consistency
2. Adheres to world-building rules
3. Follows plot structure
4. Helps develop scenes in context

### Combining Context with Tools

**Strategic Approach:**

1. **Context Files**: Core reference material
2. **AGENTS.md**: Vault structure understanding
3. **Agent Tools**: Discovery and exploration

**Example:**

```
User: Using our project architecture (in context),
      find all the API endpoints in the codebase
      and create a test plan

Agent:
1. References ARCHITECTURE.md (context)
2. Uses find_files_by_name to find endpoints
3. Uses read_file to examine each endpoint
4. Creates test plan following architecture
```

### Session Templates

Create reusable session configurations:

**Technical Writing Session:**

- Context: Style Guide, Glossary, Product Overview
- Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Custom Prompt: Technical writing assistant

**Creative Writing Session:**

- Context: Character profiles, world building
- Model: Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview (if available)
- Custom Prompt: Creative writing coach

**Research Session:**

- Context: Research questions, literature review
- Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Custom Prompt: Research assistant

## Troubleshooting

### Context Not Working

**Issue**: Added file but agent doesn't reference it

**Checks:**

1. Verify file chip is visible in chat
2. Confirm file exists in vault
3. Check file isn't corrupted
4. Try re-adding the file
5. Start a new message

**Fix**: Remove and re-add the file, or create new session

### File Not Found in @ Mentions

**Issue**: Can't find file when using @

**Reasons:**

1. File name typed incorrectly
2. File is in excluded folder
3. File doesn't exist
4. Typo in search

**Fix**:

- Check file name spelling
- Use file explorer to verify file exists
- Try partial name matching
- Check folder isn't excluded in settings

### Token Limit Exceeded

**Issue**: Error about request being too large

**Causes:**

- Too many context files
- Files are very large
- Long conversation history

**Solutions:**

1. Remove some context files
2. Create a new session (clears history)
3. Use summaries instead of full files
4. Split conversation into focused sessions

### Agent Ignoring Context

**Issue**: Agent doesn't use context files even though they're added

**Reasons:**

1. Files aren't relevant to question
2. Agent has sufficient knowledge without them
3. Files are very long (truncated in context)
4. Conversation history dominates attention

**Solutions:**

1. Explicitly reference context: "Based on the Design Doc..."
2. Ask specific questions about context content
3. Reduce conversation history by starting new session
4. Verify context files contain relevant information

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Slow responses with context files

**Causes:**

- Too many or too large files
- Token limit approaching
- Network latency

**Optimizations:**

1. Reduce number of context files
2. Use smaller, focused files
3. Remove unnecessary context
4. Consider using Pro model (larger context window)

## Migration from v3.x

If you're upgrading from v3.x, the context system changed significantly:

**Old System (v3.x):**

- Automatic link traversal
- "Send Context" toggle
- "Max Context Depth" setting
- Followed [[links]] automatically
