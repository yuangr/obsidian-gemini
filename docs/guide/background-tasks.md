# Background tasks

Long-running operations — deep research and image generation — run in the background so they never block your editing session. Results are saved to your vault automatically and you're notified when they're ready.

## Status Bar Indicator

The status bar shows a single indicator for all background work. It reflects both active background tasks and the RAG indexing state in one place.

| Appearance                     | Meaning                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hidden                         | No background work running, RAG disabled, and no pending catch-up runs              |
| Spinning loader icon + count   | One or more background tasks running (takes visual priority over RAG)               |
| Database icon + file count     | No tasks running; RAG enabled and idle                                              |
| Upload-cloud icon + percentage | RAG indexing in progress                                                            |
| Pause-circle icon              | RAG indexing paused                                                                 |
| Clock icon                     | No tasks running, RAG disabled, but missed scheduled-task runs are pending approval |

RAG `error` and `rate_limited` states don't change the icon (they fall back to the database icon) but surface a status message in the indicator's tooltip.

Click the indicator at any time to open the **Background tasks** panel.

## Background tasks Panel

The panel (also available via **Command Palette → View background tasks**) shows:

- **Running** — tasks currently in progress, with a Cancel button for each
- **Recent** — the last 20 completed, failed, or cancelled tasks

Completed tasks with output files show an **Open result** link that opens the file in Obsidian.

## How Tasks Are Created

Background tasks are created automatically when you trigger long-running operations:

- **Deep Research** — the agent is steered to run research in the background by default (via its system prompt), and when it does, the result is saved to `[state-folder]/Background-Tasks/YYYY-MM-DD <topic>.md` (you can specify a custom path via the `outputFile` parameter). This is a prompted default, not enforced by the tool itself — if the agent runs research in the foreground instead, no file is saved unless `outputFile` is set.
- **Image Generation** — generates and saves an image; result path shown in the completion notice. The **Generate image** command palette entry also routes through the background system: it returns control immediately and inserts the wikilink at your captured cursor position when the task completes (or shows a Notice with the wikilink to copy if you've moved on from the source note).

Both operations fire a completion notice with a clickable vault link when done. If a task fails, a notice explains the error.

## Cancellation

Click **Cancel** next to a running task in the panel. The task stops at the next safe checkpoint — it may not stop instantly if the underlying API call is already in flight.

## Accessing Results

When a task completes you'll see a notice in the bottom-right corner with an **Open result** link. You can also find the result by:

1. Clicking the status bar indicator → **Open result** in the Recent section
2. Navigating directly to `[state-folder]/Background-Tasks/` in the file explorer (unless you set a custom `outputFile` path)

## Troubleshooting

**Task shows as failed**
Check the error shown in the Background tasks panel. Common causes:

- API key not configured or expired
- Network timeout on long-running research queries
- Vault path conflict for image output

**Status bar indicator not visible**
The indicator is hidden only when there is nothing to show at all: no tasks running, RAG disabled, and no pending catch-up approvals. If RAG is enabled, the indicator stays visible (database icon) even when indexing is idle. Trigger a background task or enable RAG indexing in Settings.
