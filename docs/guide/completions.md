# IDE-Style Completions Guide

IDE-Style Completions bring intelligent, context-aware text suggestions to your Obsidian writing experience. Like code completion in programming IDEs, this feature predicts and suggests what you might want to write next.

## Overview

### What are IDE-Style Completions?

Completions provide:

- Real-time text suggestions as you type
- Context-aware predictions based on surrounding content
- Single-keypress acceptance (Tab)
- Seamless integration with your writing flow

### Benefits

1. **Faster Writing**: Complete sentences and paragraphs quickly
2. **Consistency**: Maintain style and terminology
3. **Idea Generation**: Get suggestions for what to write next
4. **Reduced Typing**: Especially helpful for repetitive content
5. **Learning Tool**: See how AI would continue your thoughts

## Getting Started

### Enable Completions

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`)
2. Search for "Gemini Scribe: Toggle completions"
3. Press Enter
4. See confirmation notice: "Gemini Scribe completions are now enabled." or "Gemini Scribe completions are now disabled."

### Quick Test

1. Open any markdown note
2. Type a few words and pause
3. After ~500ms, a gray suggestion appears
4. Press `Tab` to accept or any other key to dismiss

## How Completions Work

### The Completion Process

1. **You type** in your note
2. **Pause detected** (500ms without typing)
3. **Context gathered** from surrounding text
4. **AI generates** a suggestion
5. **Suggestion appears** in gray text
6. **You choose** to accept or continue typing

### Context Understanding

The AI considers:

- Previous paragraphs
- Current sentence
- Document structure
- Markdown formatting
- Your writing style

### Smart Predictions

Completions understand:

- **Lists**: Continues numbered or bulleted lists
- **Headers**: Suggests appropriate content
- **Links**: Completes wiki-links and markdown links
- **Tables**: Helps with table formatting

These aren't separate engineered features — completions use one fixed, general-purpose prompt (see [Integration with Other Features](#integration-with-other-features)) that reads the surrounding text and continues it naturally, whatever the content looks like. There's no dedicated code-language detection or per-content-type logic.

## Using Completions

### Basic Usage

1. **Start typing** normally
2. **Pause briefly** when you want a suggestion
3. **Review suggestion** (appears in gray)
4. **Accept or dismiss**:
   - `Tab`: Accept the suggestion
   - Any other key: Dismiss and continue

### Accepting Completions

**Full acceptance**: Press `Tab` once

- Entire suggestion is inserted
- Cursor moves to end
- Continue typing normally

**Dismissing**: Press any other key

- Suggestion disappears
- Your keypress is processed normally
- No text is inserted

### When Completions Appear

Suggestions trigger when:

- You pause mid-sentence
- After punctuation (. ! ?)
- At the start of new lines
- After list markers (-, \*, 1.)
- Inside markdown structures

## Configuration

### Settings

In Settings → Gemini Scribe:

**Completion model**

- Gemini Flash Lite Latest (fastest, default)
- Gemini Flash Latest (balanced)
- Gemini 2.5 Pro (highest quality, slower; requires billing)

The dropdown reflects whatever models the bundled list and Model Discovery have surfaced — the names above are today's defaults, but newer Flash / Pro models will appear automatically as Google ships them.

### Model Comparison

| Model             | Speed   | Quality | Best For                            |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Flash Lite Latest | Fastest | Good    | Most writing, note-taking (default) |
| Flash Latest      | Fast    | Better  | Longer / more nuanced suggestions   |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro    | Slowest | Best    | Critical content; requires billing  |

### Performance Tuning

Completions are optimized for:

- 500ms debounce (prevents excessive API calls)
- Smart context extraction
- Efficient caching
- Minimal UI disruption

## Writing Effectively with Completions

**Sentence Starters**

- "The main advantage is"
- "In conclusion,"
- "For example,"
- "This means that"

**Transition Phrases**

- "Furthermore,"
- "On the other hand,"
- "As a result,"

### 2. Speed Techniques

**Partial Acceptance**

- Type the beginning
- Let AI complete
- Edit if needed

- Start sections
- Accept completions
- Refine later

### 3. Learning from Suggestions

Observe how AI:

- Structures sentences
- Uses transitions
- Maintains consistency
- Formats markdown

### 4. Custom Patterns

Train the AI by:

- Using consistent formats

1. Type main points
2. Let AI expand
3. Reorganize as needed

**Brainstorming**

1. Start ideas
2. See AI suggestions
3. Build on interesting ones

## Troubleshooting

### Completions Not Appearing

1. **Check if enabled**
   - Run toggle command
   - Look for confirmation

2. **Verify file type**
   - Must be an open Markdown view (.md file)

3. **Check timing**
   - Wait full 500ms
   - Don't type too quickly

4. **API issues**
   - Verify API key
   - Check internet connection

### Poor Quality Suggestions

**Too generic**

- Provide more context
- Write clearer beginnings
- Use specific terminology

**Wrong style**

- Be consistent in document
- Use clear formatting
- Maintain tone

**Irrelevant**

- Check document structure
- Ensure logical flow
- Provide better context

### Performance Issues

**Slow suggestions**

- Switch to Gemini Flash Lite Latest (the default)
- Check network speed
- Reduce document size

**Disrupting flow**

- Type without pausing
- Disable for focused writing
- Adjust mental timing

### Conflicts

**With other plugins**

- Disable conflicting completions
- Check for keybinding conflicts
- Report compatibility issues

**With templates**

- Completions work alongside templates
- May suggest template syntax
- Edit suggestions as needed

## Best Practices

### 1. Context is Key

Write clear beginnings:

- ❌ "The thing is"
- ✅ "The main challenge with this approach is"

### 2. Pause Strategically

Pause when you:

- Need the next idea
- Want formatting help
- Seek specific information
- Feel stuck

### 3. Edit and Refine

Completions are suggestions:

- Review before accepting
- Edit after accepting
- Don't accept blindly
- Maintain your voice

### 4. Use for First Drafts

Completions excel at:

- Getting ideas flowing
- Overcoming blank pages
- Rapid prototyping
- Rough drafts

### 5. Disable When Needed

Turn off for:

- Final editing
- Precise writing
- Personal journaling
- Sensitive content

## Common Patterns

### Email Templates

```
"Thank you for" → "your email regarding..."
"I hope this" → "message finds you well"
"Please let me know" → "if you have any questions"
```

### Technical Documentation

```
"To configure" → "the settings, follow these steps:"
"The API returns" → "a JSON response containing..."
"Error handling" → "is implemented using try-catch blocks"
```

### Academic Writing

```
"This research" → "contributes to the existing literature by..."
"The findings suggest" → "a strong correlation between..."
"Further investigation" → "is needed to determine..."
```

### Note Organization

```
"## Summary" → [AI provides section structure]
"### Key Points" → [AI suggests bullet points]
"Related:" → "[[Note 1]], [[Note 2]]"
```

## Integration with Other Features

### With Custom Prompts

- Completions use a fixed, dedicated prompt template and do not read the session's active custom prompt
- Suggestions are based only on the surrounding document text, not any custom prompt's style or persona
- Custom prompts affect Chat, Rewrite, and selection features, not completions

### With Chat

- Similar AI understanding
- Complementary workflows
- Shared context awareness

### With Rewrite

- Completions for drafting
- Rewrite for major edits
- Combined for efficiency

## Conclusion

IDE-Style Completions transform your writing experience by providing intelligent, context-aware suggestions exactly when you need them. By understanding how to use this feature effectively, you can:

- Write faster without sacrificing quality
- Maintain consistency across documents
- Overcome writer's block
- Learn new writing patterns
- Focus on ideas rather than mechanics

Start with completions enabled during regular note-taking, observe how the AI understands your context, and gradually incorporate suggestions into your workflow. Remember: completions are a tool to enhance, not replace, your unique writing voice.

The key is finding the right balance—knowing when to accept suggestions and when to write freely. With practice, completions become an invisible assistant that helps you express your thoughts more efficiently.
