## Overview

Custom prompts are markdown files that contain special instructions for the AI. When you apply a custom prompt to a session, it changes how the AI interacts with you — its tone, style, focus areas, and the knowledge it brings to the conversation.

Use custom prompts to:

- Customize AI behavior for different types of content
- Set a conversational style or persona (e.g., technical writer, creative coach)
- Seed the agent with background knowledge before a conversation
- Maintain consistent AI behavior across similar documents
- Share prompt templates with other users

### Custom Prompts vs Skills

If you're unsure whether you need a custom prompt or a [skill](/guide/agent-skills), here's the key difference:

|                | Custom Prompts                                 | Skills                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | Change _how_ the agent talks to you            | Define _what_ the agent does step-by-step                   |
| **Best for**   | Style, tone, persona, background context       | Repeatable workflows, multi-step procedures                 |
| **Applied to** | A session (via session settings)               | Activated on demand per task                                |
| **Example**    | "Respond as a technical editor using AP style" | "Read my meetings, create notes for each, add action items" |

**Rule of thumb:** If you want to change the agent's personality or give it background knowledge, use a custom prompt. If you have a specific procedure with discrete steps you want the agent to follow, create a skill.

## Getting Started

### Locate the Prompts Folder

Custom prompts are stored in: `[state-folder]/Prompts/`

For example, if your plugin state folder is `gemini-scribe`, prompts will be in `gemini-scribe/Prompts/`.

The plugin automatically creates this folder structure and adds an example prompt when you first enable the feature:

- `gemini-scribe/` - Main plugin state folder
- `gemini-scribe/Prompts/` - Custom prompt templates
- `gemini-scribe/Agent-Sessions/` - Agent session history files (if session history is enabled)

## Creating Custom Prompts

### Quick Start with Command Palette

The easiest way to create a new custom prompt:

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
2. Search for "Gemini Scribe: Create new custom prompt"
3. Enter a name for your prompt
4. Edit the generated template to suit your needs

### Manual Creation

You can also create prompt files manually in your Prompts folder.

### Basic Structure

Every custom prompt file has two parts:

1. **Frontmatter** (YAML metadata)
2. **Prompt Content** (instructions for the AI)

### Frontmatter Properties

```yaml
---
name: 'Your Prompt Name' # Required: Display name
description: 'What this prompt does' # Required: Brief description
version: 1 # Optional: Version number
override_system_prompt: false # Optional: Replace system prompt entirely
tags: ['category', 'use-case'] # Optional: For organization
---
```

#### Special Tags

| Tag                              | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `gemini-scribe/selection-prompt` | Makes the prompt available in the right-click "Explain Selection" / "Ask about selection" menu. See [Selection Prompts](/guide/selection-prompts) and the [AI Writing Guide](/guide/ai-writing#explain-selection) for details. |

### Example: Technical Documentation Assistant

```markdown
---
name: 'Technical Documentation'
description: 'Helps write clear, structured technical documentation'

- Highlight common pitfalls

Always aim for documentation that is both comprehensive and accessible to readers of varying technical levels.
```

## Using Custom Prompts

### Command Palette Commands

#### Create new custom prompt

- **Command**: "Gemini Scribe: Create new custom prompt"
- **Purpose**: Creates a new custom prompt file with a proper template
- **How it works**:
  1. Opens a modal to enter the prompt name
  2. Creates a new `.md` file in your Prompts folder
  3. Fills in the frontmatter template with helpful structure
  4. Automatically opens the file for editing

### Applying Prompts to Sessions

Custom prompts are applied at the session level via the session settings (gear icon) in the agent panel:

1. Open the agent panel
2. Click the gear icon in the session header
3. Select a prompt from the "Prompt template" dropdown
4. The prompt applies to all messages in that session

### Visual Indicator

When a custom prompt is active, you'll see a badge in the session header showing the prompt name.

## Advanced Features

### System Prompt Override

For advanced users who want complete control:

1. Set `override_system_prompt: true` in your prompt file
2. Enable "Allow System Prompt Override" in plugin settings
3. Your prompt will completely replace the default system instructions

**Warning:** Use with caution as this removes built-in safety features and Obsidian-specific knowledge.

### Prompt templates for Different Use Cases

Create specialized prompts for:

- **Academic Writing**: Citation formatting, scholarly tone
- **Creative Writing**: Character development, narrative flow
- **Code Reviews**: Best practices, security considerations
- **Meeting Notes**: Action items, key decisions
- **Research Notes**: Source evaluation, synthesis

### Organizing Prompts

Use descriptive filenames and tags:

```
Prompts/
├── Writing/
│   ├── Academic Writing.md
│   ├── Creative Writing.md
│   └── Technical Writing.md
├── Coding/
│   ├── Code Review.md
│   └── Documentation.md
└── Research/
    ├── Literature Review.md
    └── Data Analysis.md
```

```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Instructions Clear and Specific

- Use bullet points and sections for organization
- Be explicit about desired behaviors
- Include examples when helpful

### 2. Test Your Prompts

- Try the prompt with various types of content
- Refine based on AI responses
- Iterate to improve effectiveness

### 3. Version Control

- Use the `version` field to track changes
- Keep backups of effective prompts
- Document what works well

### 4. Share and Collaborate

- Export prompts as markdown files
- Share with team members
- Build a library of proven prompts

### 5. Balance Specificity and Flexibility

- Too specific: AI becomes rigid
- Too general: No meaningful behavior change
- Find the sweet spot for your use case

## Troubleshooting

### Prompt Not Working

1. **Check the prompt file syntax**
   - Ensure proper YAML frontmatter formatting
   - Verify required fields (`name`, `description`) are present

2. **Confirm the file location**
   - Prompt file exists in the `[state-folder]/Prompts/` folder (there's no separate "enable custom prompts" toggle — any valid prompt file there is available)

3. **Check session settings**
   - Open the session settings (gear icon) and verify the prompt is selected

### AI Behaving Unexpectedly

1. **Review prompt instructions**
   - Look for contradictions
   - Ensure clarity

2. **Check override settings**
   - System prompt override might be removing expected behaviors
   - Try with `override_system_prompt: false`

3. **Test incrementally**
   - Start with simple instructions
   - Add complexity gradually

### Performance Issues

- Very long prompts may slow responses
- Keep prompts focused and concise
- Remove unnecessary instructions

## Tips for Effective Prompts

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic instructions and add complexity as needed
2. **Use Examples**: Show the AI what you want with concrete examples
3. **Set Boundaries**: Clearly state what the AI should and shouldn't do
4. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on actual usage
5. **Document Success**: Keep notes on what works well

## Conclusion

Custom prompts are a powerful way to tailor Gemini Scribe to your specific needs. By creating thoughtful, well-structured prompts, you can transform the AI into a specialized assistant for any task. Start with the examples provided, experiment with your own ideas, and build a library of prompts that enhance your Obsidian workflow.

Remember: The best prompt is one that consistently produces the results you need. Don't hesitate to experiment and refine until you find what works for you.
