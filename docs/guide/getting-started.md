# Getting Started

Welcome to Gemini Scribe, an Obsidian plugin that integrates Google's Gemini AI models as an intelligent agent that can actively work with your vault.

> **Gemini Scribe is agent-first** — every conversation is powered by an AI agent with tool-calling capabilities. The agent can search files, create notes, research topics, and execute multi-step tasks autonomously while respecting your permissions.

## Installation

### Community Plugins (Recommended)

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Navigate to "Community plugins"
3. Ensure "Restricted mode" is OFF
4. Click "Browse" and search for "Gemini Scribe"
5. Click "Install" and then "Enable"

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/allenhutchison/obsidian-gemini/releases) page (you'll need `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`)
2. Create a folder named `obsidian-gemini` inside your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory
3. Copy the downloaded files into the `obsidian-gemini` folder
4. In Obsidian, go to Settings → Community plugins and enable "Gemini Scribe"

## Quick Start

1. **Get an API Key** — Get your free key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. **Configure** — Add your API key in Settings → Gemini Scribe
3. **Initialize Context** — Click "Initialize vault context" to help the agent understand your vault
4. **Start Chatting** — Open Gemini chat with the ribbon icon or command palette and start giving the AI tasks!

### Prefer running models locally?

Gemini Scribe also supports [Ollama](https://ollama.com) as a provider so you can use local models such as Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5, or Gemma 3 without an API key. Some Gemini-built-in features (Google Search, URL Context, Deep Research, image generation, RAG) are unavailable on Ollama. See the [Ollama Setup Guide](/guide/ollama-setup) for details.

## Feature Overview

### Agent mode (Core Feature)

An AI assistant that can actively work with your vault through tool calling.

- Search and read files in your vault
- Create, modify, and organize notes
- Research topics with web search and URL fetching
- Execute complex workflows autonomously
- Respect your permissions with granular controls

**Example tasks:**

- "Find all notes tagged with #important and create a summary"
- "Research quantum computing and create a new note with your findings"
- "Organize my meeting notes from this week into a weekly summary"

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the Agent** — The agent is your primary interface. Be specific about what you want it to do and let it break down complex tasks into steps.
2. **Initialize vault context** — Use "Initialize vault context" to help the agent understand your vault. Update it periodically as your vault grows.
3. **Use Context Files** — Add relevant notes as context with @ mentions for focused sessions.
4. **Set Appropriate Permissions** — Configure which operations require confirmation. Balance convenience with safety.
5. **Leverage Persistent Sessions** — Continue conversations across Obsidian restarts and build on previous work.

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues**

If you see a message about a missing or inaccessible API key:

1. **Get a free Gemini API key** — Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and click "Create API Key". A Google account is all you need.
2. **Enter your key in settings** — Open Obsidian Settings, navigate to Gemini Scribe, and paste your key into the API Key field. The key is stored securely using Obsidian's secret storage.
3. **Key not working after entry?** — If you see "Could not retrieve your API key from secure storage", try clearing the field and re-entering your key. This can happen if Obsidian's secure storage was reset (e.g., after a system update or vault migration).
4. **Check the developer console** — Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Opt+I` (macOS) to open the console and look for error messages prefixed with `[Gemini Scribe]`.

**Agent Not Responding**

- Check API key validity in Settings
- Verify internet connection
- Ensure your model supports tool calling (all current models support this)

**Tools Failing**

- Check file permissions and paths
- Verify files exist and are accessible
- System folders (Obsidian's configuration folder — `.obsidian` by default, or a renamed one — and plugin folders) are protected from modifications

**Poor Quality Output**

- Add specific notes as context files
- Be more specific in your requests
- Try Gemini 2.5 Pro for more capable responses

**Performance Issues**

- Use Gemini Flash for faster responses
- Reduce context file count for quicker processing
- Break up large requests into smaller tasks

**Session Issues**

- Try creating a new session
- Check console (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I) for errors
- Verify session files aren't corrupted

For detailed configuration, see the [Settings Reference](/reference/settings) and [Advanced Settings Guide](/reference/advanced-settings).
