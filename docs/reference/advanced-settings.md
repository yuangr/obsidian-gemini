# Advanced Settings Guide

This guide covers the advanced settings available in Gemini Scribe, including model parameter tuning, API configuration, and developer options.

## Accessing Advanced Settings

Advanced settings are hidden by default to keep the interface clean. To access them:

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Navigate to **Gemini Scribe** under Community plugins
3. In the **General** section, scroll to the bottom and click **Show advanced settings**

## Model Parameter Controls

### Temperature Settings

**Temperature** controls the randomness and creativity of AI responses:

- **Range**: 0 to 2.0 (dynamically adjusted based on available models)
- **Default**: 0.7
- **Lower values** (0.0-0.5): More deterministic, consistent responses
- **Higher values** (1.0-2.0): More creative, varied responses

**When to adjust:**

- Creative writing: Use higher temperature (1.0-1.5)
- Technical documentation: Use lower temperature (0.2-0.5)
- General chat: Default (0.7) works well

### Top P Settings

**Top P** controls the diversity of word choices the AI considers:

- **Range**: 0 to 1.0 (always fixed range for Gemini models)
- **Default**: `1.0`
- **Lower values** (0.1-0.5): More focused, predictable responses
- **Higher values** (0.8-1.0): More diverse, exploratory responses

**When to adjust:**

- Focused analysis: Use lower Top P (0.3-0.7)
- Brainstorming: Use higher Top P (0.9-1.0)
- Balanced responses: Use default values

### Dynamic Parameter Ranges

Gemini Scribe automatically discovers the parameter limits for your available models:

- **Temperature ranges** adapt to the maximum supported by your models
- **Model-specific limits** are enforced to prevent API errors
- **Real-time validation** adjusts values that exceed model capabilities
- **Informational displays** show the actual ranges and default values

## API configuration

### Use Interactions API

Route Gemini requests through Google's newer [Interactions API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/interactions) (`interactions.create`) instead of the legacy `generateContent` API. Google has made the Interactions API generally available and is steering new development toward it, so it is now the plugin's default transport.

- **Setting name**: Use Interactions API
- **Default**: on. Existing installs are migrated to the Interactions API automatically on upgrade — a one-time flip you can reverse by turning the toggle off, which is then respected on future launches.
- **Scope**: Gemini provider only — the toggle is hidden when the provider is Ollama.
- **Privacy**: The plugin runs the Interactions API **statelessly** (`store: false`). Conversation history is replayed with each request, and the plugin does not persist Interactions state on Google's side between turns. (Requests are still sent to Google to generate each response, subject to Google's standard API data-handling terms.)
- **Status**: Default transport. If you hit problems, turn it off to fall back to the proven `generateContent` path. Responses stream incrementally, including reasoning and tool calls.

### Custom API Endpoint

Route all Google API requests through a proxy or gateway instead of hitting the public endpoint directly.

- **Setting name**: Custom API endpoint
- **Default**: empty (uses official Google endpoint)
- **When to use**:
  - Corporate networks that block `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` or `aiplatform.googleapis.com`
  - Local reverse proxies for API key management or cost tracking
  - Regional mirrors for latency or compliance requirements
- **Scope**: Every Google GenAI SDK call site is covered — chat, streaming, image generation, web fetch, Google Search/Maps grounding, RAG indexing, deep research, and context management (token counting). Leaving one path unproxied while routing others is not possible with this setting.
- **Validation**: The value is validated on blur; invalid URLs will show a warning notice and be cleared automatically.

### Retry Settings

Configure how the plugin handles API failures:

**Maximum retries**

- **Default**: 3 attempts
- **Range**: any integer ≥ 0 (no upper bound is enforced)
- **Purpose**: Handles temporary network issues or API rate limits

**Initial Backoff Delay**

- **Default**: 1000ms (1 second)
- **Range**: any integer ≥ 0 (no upper bound is enforced)
- **Purpose**: Time to wait before first retry (uses exponential backoff)

**How retry works:**

1. First attempt fails
2. Wait initial delay (e.g., 1 second)
3. Second attempt fails
4. Wait double the delay (e.g., 2 seconds)
5. Third attempt fails
6. Wait quadruple the delay (e.g., 4 seconds)
7. Final attempt or success

## Model Discovery

Model discovery is automatic — no configuration is required. On startup, the plugin fetches the latest available Gemini models from GitHub and caches the result for 24 hours. If the fetch fails, the bundled static model list is used as a fallback.

Both providers expose a **Refresh model list** button in Settings → General:

- **Gemini** — bypasses the 24-hour cache and re-fetches the remote model list immediately. You can also trigger this from the command palette with **Gemini Scribe: Refresh model list** (`gemini-scribe:refresh-model-list`). Useful when a newly-published model doesn't appear yet.
- **Ollama** — re-queries the Ollama daemon for any models you've pulled since the plugin loaded (`ollama pull <name>`). Use this instead of restarting Obsidian.

## Performance Optimization

### Context management

In v4.0+, context is manually managed through session-based file selection:

**Context File Selection:**

- Use @ mentions in chat to add files as persistent context
- Context files are included with every message in the session
- Start with 2-3 relevant files and add more as needed
- Remove unused context files to save token budget

**AGENTS.md - Vault Context:**

- Create AGENTS.md via "Initialize vault context" button
- Provides AI with overview of your vault structure
- Enables better file discovery without adding every file as context
- Update periodically as your vault evolves

**Optimization tips:**

- Start minimal (2-3 files) and expand as needed
- Use AGENTS.md for vault-wide awareness instead of adding many context files
- Let agent use tools to read additional files on-demand
- Monitor token usage in long conversations
- Use Flash models for faster responses

### Model Selection Strategy

**For Chat (Quality focused):**

- Primary: Gemini Flash Latest (default)
- Alternative: Gemini 2.5 Pro for harder reasoning (requires billing)

**For Completions (Speed focused):**

- Primary: Gemini Flash Lite Latest (default)
- Alternative: Gemini Flash Latest if you want richer suggestions

**For Summaries (Balanced):**

- Primary: Gemini Flash Latest (default)
- Alternative: Gemini 2.5 Pro for long or technical documents

## Best Practices

### Parameter Tuning

1. **Start with defaults** - They work well for most use cases
2. **Make incremental changes** - Adjust by 0.1-0.2 at a time
3. **Test with your content** - Different content types may need different settings
4. **Document your preferences** - Keep notes on what works for different tasks

### API Management

1. **Monitor usage** - Check Google AI Studio for API quota
2. **Use appropriate models** - Don't use Pro models for simple tasks
3. **Adjust retry settings** - More retries for unreliable connections
4. **Enable fallback models** - Ensures continued functionality

### Model List

1. **Use Refresh model list** in Settings → General (or run **Gemini Scribe: Refresh model list** from the command palette) to pick up newly published Gemini models without waiting for the 24-hour cache to expire
2. **Use Refresh model list** (Ollama provider) after pulling new models with `ollama pull`
3. **Check your API key** if the model list looks empty or stale

## Troubleshooting

### Parameter Issues

**Temperature/Top P not taking effect:**

- Check if model supports the parameter range
- Verify settings are saved (restart Obsidian if needed)
- Look for validation warnings in notices

**Extreme responses:**

- Lower temperature if too random
- Adjust Top P if responses are too narrow/broad
- Reset to defaults if unsure

### API Problems

**Frequent failures:**

- Increase retry count
- Extend initial backoff delay
- Check API key permissions
- Verify internet connection

**Slow responses:**

- Reduce number of context files in session
- Use faster models (Flash variants)
- Start new session to clear conversation history
- Lower retry count for quicker failures

### Model List Issues

**Models not appearing or stale:**

- For Gemini: click **Refresh model list** in Settings → General (or run the **Gemini Scribe: Refresh model list** command) to bypass the 24-hour cache; check API key validity and network connectivity if it still fails
- For Ollama: click **Refresh model list** in Settings → General after pulling new models
- If the list still looks wrong after refreshing, restart Obsidian

## Security Considerations

### API Key Protection

- **Secure storage** - Your API key is stored using Obsidian's SecretStorage API, not in plaintext `data.json`
- **Never share** your API key
- **Use environment variables** for development
- **Rotate keys regularly** as a security practice
- **Monitor usage** for unauthorized access

### Data Privacy

- **Direct API calls** - Data goes only to Google
- **Local storage** - Chat history stays in your vault
- **No third parties** - No intermediate servers involved
- **Encryption** - Consider vault encryption for sensitive data

### Safe Settings

- **Review parameter changes** - Extreme values may produce unexpected results
- **Test with non-sensitive data** - Before using on important content
- **Backup regularly** - Especially when experimenting with settings
- **Use version control** - Track changes to your vault
