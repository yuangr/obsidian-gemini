/**
 * LLM-as-judge for prose-heavy eval rubrics (#713).
 *
 * The judge is intentionally separate from the system under test:
 *
 *   - It always uses Gemini, even when the system under test is Ollama,
 *     so the judgment itself doesn't change when we swap the agent's model.
 *   - The model id is **pinned** via `EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL` (default
 *     `gemini-3.5-flash`) per #687's reliability methodology — pinning means
 *     a model-swap experiment doesn't make the verdict a moving target.
 *     The current default was selected against the #870 calibration set
 *     (PR #889 measurement, #871 decision): 94.4% agreement with human
 *     ground truth, vs. 92.2% for the previous `gemini-2.5-flash`. The
 *     win came from being non-brittle on cosmetic response formatting
 *     and catching a fabrication case that flash-lite missed; the cost
 *     is well below 1¢ per single-model sweep.
 *   - `temperature: 0` plus a strict YES/NO contract minimizes nondeterminism;
 *     the residual flake gets caught by `pass^k` repetition.
 *
 * Failure modes:
 *
 *   - No API key reachable → `createJudge` returns `null`. Callers treat
 *     this as "judge unavailable"; tasks with `judge` matchers will fail
 *     (loudly via the result detail) rather than silently pass. Ollama-only
 *     runs can set `EVAL_JUDGE_API_KEY` so the judge is independent of the
 *     active plugin provider and credential state.
 *   - Model returns anything other than YES/NO → conservatively NO. We do
 *     not try to substring-search "yes" inside a longer reply, because models
 *     sometimes write "yes, the response covers most but not…" which should
 *     not pass.
