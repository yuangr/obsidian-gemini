# Gemini Scribe for Obsidian

Gemini Scribe is an Obsidian plugin that integrates Google's Gemini AI models, providing powerful AI-driven assistance for note-taking, writing, and knowledge management directly within Obsidian. It leverages your notes as context for AI interactions, making it a highly personalized and integrated experience.

> **Note:** Connect a provider in plugin settings → **Providers**:
>
> - **Google Gemini (cloud)** — requires a Gemini API key (free tier available at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)).
> - **Ollama** — runs on your machine with no API key; install [Ollama](https://ollama.com), pull a model, and select it on the Ollama card. Ollama cloud models (marked "cloud" in the picker) are forwarded to ollama.com. See [docs/guide/ollama-setup.md](docs/guide/ollama-setup.md) for details.
> - **OpenAI (cloud)** — requires your own OpenAI API key, or point it at an OpenAI-compatible server (LM Studio, MLX, ...) with any placeholder key. See [docs/guide/openai-setup.md](docs/guide/openai-setup.md) for details.
> - **Anthropic (cloud)** — requires your own Anthropic API key; runs Claude models (Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Haiku 4.5, …) with adaptive thinking and image/PDF input. See [docs/guide/anthropic-setup.md](docs/guide/anthropic-setup.md) for details.
>
> Then route each feature to a provider on the **Features** page. See the [provider capability matrix](docs/reference/provider-capabilities.md) for what's supported on each.

## What's New in v4.12.1

**🛠️ Gemini Scribe 4.12.1 - Plugin audit compliance & fixes**

_4.12.1 is a patch for the 4.12 line — a few fixes on top of the full 4.12 feature set:_

- **✅ Obsidian directory audit compliance** - The 4.12.0 build was flagged by Obsidian's plugin audit; the code now passes it without suppressing any checks. Destructive buttons use Obsidian's own destructive styling, agent progress and thinking indicators render with Obsidian's DOM helpers, the OAuth callback server only loads on desktop, and the mobile layout fix no longer relies on inline or `!important` styles. (#1610, #1614)
- **📱 Agent view on mobile** - Commands that act on the agent view now find the one you're looking at on mobile instead of a hidden sidebar copy. (#1610)
- **🖼️ Image generation tool only when it can run** - The agent's `generate_image` tool is registered only when image generation is routed to a provider that's actually connected, so it no longer appears and then fails with a missing key. (#1611)
- **🌍 Translation refresh** - Updated UI translations. (#1606)

_The full 4.12 feature set is unchanged — the multi-provider release, with two new providers, per-feature routing, and a rebuilt settings page:_

- **🌍 Anthropic (Claude) and OpenAI-compatible providers** - Two new providers join Gemini and Ollama: Anthropic Claude models (with adaptive thinking and image/PDF input) and OpenAI or any OpenAI-compatible server such as LM Studio or MLX (custom base URL + API key), each with streaming and tool calling. (#1532, #1286, #1288)
- **🧭 Per-feature routing** - Chat, summaries, completions, rewrite, web search, deep research, RAG, and image generation each route to their own provider and model; a feature routed to a provider that isn't set up stays off instead of silently falling back to another provider. (#1266)
- **⚙️ Settings redesign** - A rebuilt settings page with provider connection cards and a Features routing table, built on Obsidian 1.13's settings API; obsolete toggles (streaming, Interactions API, temperature/top-p, retry, loop-detection, MCP enable, and the ineffective system-prompt override) are gone and your settings migrate automatically. (#1508, #1477)
- **🖼️ OpenAI image generation** - Image generation now works on OpenAI models too, selectable per feature. (#1583)
- **⚡ Interactions API on for everyone** - Gemini requests use the Interactions API transport by default, and thought signatures are carried correctly through streaming and non-streaming tool calls. (#1191, #1256, #1269, #1603)
- **🛡️ Sturdier agent runs** - Tool results always stay paired with their calls in replayed turns, tool-call ids survive into function responses, a failed tool ends the turn by default again (configurable), the loop detector shows a notice on its first fire, retry backoff yields to cancellation, Stop aborts the underlying stream, and the token readout now shows reasoning tokens. (#1561, #1443, #1591, #1537, #1453, #1349, #1441)
- **🤖 Model catalog** - Gemma models join the weekly model update, new Gemini models were added, gemini-3-pro-preview users are migrated to its 3.1 successor, Gemini 2.5 works again on both API paths, and interactions-only models (Gemini Omni) route correctly. (#1562, #1239, #1224, #1222, #1225)
- **🐛 Fixes** - Session delete uses an inline confirm and renames are collision-safe (#1280, #1221, #1423, #1476); history tool blocks collapse again (#1277); drop, paste, and @-mention share one attachment path with the 20 MB budget held against rasterized images (#1412, #1434); project discovery tools treat the project root as a hard scope, and Switch/Create project commands work as expected (#1520, #1607); scheduled-task and hook reliability fixes, including stale lifecycle writes, apostrophes in frontmatter, and state-folder renames (#1462, #1347, #1584, #1553, #1555, #1594); MCP tool classification follows the server's `destructiveHint` and OAuth HTML-page errors are explained (#1456, #1601); Ollama resolves the context window per model (#1281); plugin load no longer crashes on iOS < 16.4 (#1257); no model-list requests go to providers you haven't set up (#1604); RAG search retries like other calls (#1429); double-spaced code blocks fixed (#1408); /skill inserts a literal token (#1198); more error messages are translated (#1444, #1541, #1546).
- **⚠️ Upgrade notes** - Requires Obsidian 1.13.1 or later. Known limitation: with Anthropic, if context compaction fires in the middle of a tool chain the request can fail with a 400.

**Previous Updates (v4.11.0):**

- **🎨 Design system overhaul** - A refreshed visual identity built on a new theme-adaptive design-token layer: a signature Gemini accent (bold user message bubbles, a gradient send button, and a brand mark), a unified elevation/shadow scale, a gradient progress bar across all states, motion polish, and consistent icon sizing — adapting cleanly to light, dark, and custom themes. (#1090, #1104, #1107, #1109, #1110, #1112)
- **📋 Plan Mode (opt-in)** - A new toggle in the agent view (and a command) that has the agent lay out its plan before it starts acting, shown as a "Plan" pill; leave it off for the usual direct execution. (#1046)
- **⚙️ Background execution by default for long-running tools** - Deep research and image generation now run in the background automatically, so the agent view stays responsive and you can track them in the Background Tasks panel. (#1085)
- **⏹️ Stop halts a streaming response immediately** - The Stop button now cancels a mid-stream follow-up right away instead of waiting for it to finish, and follow-up requests stream live as they arrive. (#1053, #1097)
- **🖥️ Ollama improvements** - A single Ollama model field that persists independently, so switching Gemini → Ollama → Gemini no longer changes your Gemini chat model; automatic vision-capability detection; and accurate token counts from the model's own reporting. (#1125, #1058, #1076, #1152)
- **🖼️ SVG attachments** - SVG and SVGZ files are now rasterized to PNG before being sent to the model, so vector images work as attachments. (#1082)
- **📱 Cleaner startup, especially on mobile** - The plugin no longer triggers "attempted to load NodeJS package" notices when it loads, fixing startup toast spam and a latent mobile-compatibility gap. (#1154)
- **🧠 Smarter long agent runs** - Context is now compacted during a long tool chain (not just before a turn), so extended runs stay within budget without dropping the work already in flight. (#1074)
- **🔎 RAG polish** - "Reindex All" is renamed "Rescan Vault" to match what it does, and the "show all files" affordance is now keyboard-accessible. (#1056, #1159)
- **🐛 Fixes** - Deep Research works again on `@google/genai` 2.x (#1151); agent tool logs no longer fold into the preceding reasoning block in session history (#1084); and error messages no longer mislabel non-network failures as connectivity problems (#1153).
- **🔧 Under the hood** - The plugin's entire softened-lint backlog is now cleared and enforced at zero warnings and all 150 circular imports were eliminated, moving the Obsidian community-directory review toward clean. (#1032)

**Previous Updates (v4.10.2):**

- **🛠️ Interactions API transport fix** - Restored the opt-in Interactions API transport, which failed with a CORS error after the `@google/genai` 2.10.0 update; requests route through Obsidian's `requestUrl` again. (#1045)
- **🗑️ Safer file deletion** - Agent deletions now follow your Obsidian "Deleted files" setting (system trash or `.trash`) instead of permanently removing files. (#1030)

**Previous Updates (v4.10.1):**

- **📝 Notes-only patch** - Completed the 4.10.0 release notes (which omitted several of the features above); no functional changes.

**Previous Updates (v4.9.1):**

- **🗂️ Initialize vault context fix** - Fixed the "Initialize vault context" / "Update vault context" button, which was sending a malformed model request and failing to generate AGENTS.md. The feature now works correctly.

**Previous Updates (v4.9.0):**

**🪝 Gemini Scribe 4.9 - Lifecycle Hooks, Stable Prefix Caching, Custom Endpoint**

- **🪝 Lifecycle hooks** - Trigger headless AI agent runs in response to vault events (file created, modified, deleted, renamed). Create and manage hooks from the **Open hook manager** command. See the [Lifecycle Hooks guide](docs/guide/lifecycle-hooks.md).
- **⚡ Stable prefix caching** - The agent's system instruction is now byte-stable across turns and tool follow-ups, restoring Gemini's implicit prefix cache so long sessions stop reprocessing history each turn.
- **🌐 Custom API endpoint** - New setting to route all Gemini API calls through a proxy or alternate endpoint, covering every SDK call site.
- **📐 Collapsible settings sections** - Settings page reorganized into foldable sections for a cleaner UI.
- **🔐 MCP hardening** - Stdio server environment variables now live in Obsidian's encrypted SecretStorage; offline or unreachable MCP servers no longer block plugin load.
- **🛡️ Unified tool-policy** - Sessions, Projects, Scheduled tasks, and Hooks now share one policy model so per-feature permissions behave consistently.
- **📦 Two-phase context compaction** - Long conversations truncate older tool-result payloads first, summarize second, for cleaner handling near the token limit.

**Previous Updates (v4.8.0):**

- **⏰ Scheduled tasks** - Run agent tasks on a cron, time-of-day, or day-of-week schedule with full management UI. See the [Scheduled tasks guide](docs/guide/scheduled-tasks.md).
- **🌙 Missed-run catch-up** - Tasks that should have run while Obsidian was closed surface on startup for review.
- **🛰️ Background tasks** - Deep research and image generation now run in the background with output consolidated under `[state-folder]/Background-Tasks/`. See the [Background tasks guide](docs/guide/background-tasks.md).
- **🦙 Ollama provider** - Point the plugin at a local Ollama server for offline, local-model chat. See the [Ollama Setup guide](docs/guide/ollama-setup.md).
- **🛑 Runaway-loop abort** - Repeated tool-loop detections within a turn now abort the turn with a clear notice instead of churning.
- **🛠️ Headless agent loop** - AgentLoop extracted from the agent view so scheduled and background runners share the same execution engine.

## Features

- **Agent mode with Tool Calling:** An AI agent that can actively work with your vault! It can search for files, read content, create new notes, edit existing ones, move and rename files, create folders, and even conduct deep research with proper citations. Features persistent sessions, granular permission controls, session-specific model configuration, a diff review view that lets you inspect and edit proposed file changes before they're written, and **Plan Mode** — an opt-in UI affordance that generates a step-by-step plan for your approval before the agent acts.
- **Semantic Vault Search:** Search your vault by meaning, not just keywords. Uses Google's File Search API to index your notes in the background. The AI can find relevant content even when you don't remember exact words. Supports PDFs and attachments, with pause/resume controls and detailed status tracking.
- **Context-Aware Agent:** Add specific notes as persistent context for your agent sessions. The agent can access and reference these context files throughout your conversation, providing highly relevant and personalized responses.
- **Smart Summarization:** Quickly generate concise, one-sentence summaries of your notes and automatically store them in the document's frontmatter, using a model you choose for summarization.
- **Selection-Based AI Features:** Work with selected text in powerful ways:
  - **Rewrite**: Transform selected text with custom instructions - right-click and choose "Gemini Scribe: Rewrite text..."
  - **Explain Selection**: Get AI explanations using customizable prompts - right-click and choose "Gemini Scribe: Apply prompt..."
  - **Ask about selection**: Ask any question about selected text - right-click and choose "Gemini Scribe: Ask question..."
- **IDE-Style Completions:** Get real-time, context-aware text completions as you type, similar to IDEs. Accept completions with `Tab` or dismiss with any other key. This feature uses its own model, separate from chat, so you can pick a fast one.
- **Persistent Agent sessions:** Store your agent conversation history directly in your vault as markdown files. Each session is stored in the `gemini-scribe/Agent-Sessions/` folder, making it easy to backup, version control, and continue conversations across sessions.
- **Configurable Models:** Choose a provider and model for each feature — chat, summarization, completions, and rewrite — allowing you to tailor the AI's behavior to each task.
- **Custom Prompt System:** Create reusable AI instruction templates for agent sessions, allowing you to customize the AI's behavior for different workflows (e.g., technical documentation, creative writing, research). Includes command palette commands for easy creation and management.
- **Image Paste Support:** Paste images directly into the chat input to send them to the chat model for multimodal analysis. Images are automatically saved to your Obsidian attachment folder, displayed as thumbnails before sending, and the AI receives the image path for embedding in notes.
- **MCP Server Support:** [Experimental] Connect to [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers to extend the agent with external tools. Supports stdio (desktop) and HTTP transports (all platforms including mobile), with OAuth authentication for remote servers. Configure per-tool trust settings with seamless integration into the confirmation flow.
- **Scheduled tasks:** Automate recurring AI prompts — daily summaries, weekly reports, periodic vault maintenance — without manual intervention. Create and manage tasks from the **Open scheduler** command or Settings → Gemini Scribe → Automation. Each task has a frontmatter schedule (`daily`, `daily@HH:MM`, `weekly`, `weekly@HH:MM:DAYS`, `interval:Xm`, etc.) and a prompt body; tasks run as headless agent sessions and write output to your vault. Supports per-task model and tool-category overrides, a configurable tool-iteration cap (`maxIterations`, default 20) for long multi-step runs, catch-up runs for tasks missed while Obsidian was closed (`runIfMissed: true`), automatic pause after repeated failures, and a task monitor via the command palette.
- **Lifecycle Hooks:** [Opt-in] Trigger headless AI agent runs in response to vault events — file created, modified, deleted, or renamed. Create and manage hooks from the **Open hook manager** command or Settings → Gemini Scribe → Automation. Each hook specifies a trigger, an optional path glob and frontmatter filter, and a prompt template; runs include debounce, per-hour rate limits, cooldown, a configurable tool-iteration cap (`maxIterations`, default 20), and auto-pause guards to keep API costs in check. Requires enabling the `hooksEnabled` setting.
- **Projects:** Create scoped agent profiles for different areas of your vault. A project bundles custom instructions, file scope, skill selection, and permission overrides into a single configuration. The agent auto-detects projects from your folder structure and applies project-specific behavior — including scoped file discovery, filtered skills, and per-tool permission overrides. See the [Projects guide](https://allenhutchison.github.io/obsidian-gemini/guide/projects) for details and the [blog post](https://allen.hutchison.org/2026/04/09/scoping-ai-context-with-projects-in-gemini-scribe/) for a walkthrough.
- **Agent Skills:** Create, edit, and use extensible skill packages that give the agent specialized knowledge and workflows. Skills follow the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification and are stored in your plugin state folder. The agent automatically discovers available skills and activates them on demand. Update existing skills via the `edit_skill` tool with diff review.
- **Built-in Prompt templates:** The plugin uses carefully crafted Handlebars templates for system prompts, agent prompts, summarization prompts, selection rewrite prompts, and completion prompts. These ensure consistent and effective AI interaction.
- **Data Privacy:** Requests for a feature go straight to whichever provider serves it — Google for Gemini, your Ollama server (local by default, but configurable to a remote host), OpenAI (or a compatible server) for OpenAI, or Anthropic for Claude — with no intermediate server unless you configure one yourself (e.g. a custom Gemini API endpoint). See [Provider Capabilities](docs/reference/provider-capabilities.md#privacy-semantics) for the full breakdown. Agent session history is stored locally in your Obsidian vault as markdown files.
- **Robust Session Management:**
  - Persistent agent sessions that survive restarts
  - Session-specific permissions and settings
  - Context files that persist across the session
  - Full conversation history with tool execution logs
  - Easy backup and version control of sessions
  - Automatic context compaction when conversations grow large
  - Optional token usage display showing real-time context consumption

## Quick Start

1. Install the plugin from Community Plugins
2. Get your free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
3. Add the API key in plugin settings
4. Open Agent Chat with the ribbon icon or command palette
5. Manage sessions directly with command palette actions: "New agent session", "Browse agent sessions", "Link project to agent session", and "Agent session settings"
6. Start using the AI agent to work with your vault!

**Prefer running models locally, or already have an OpenAI or Anthropic key?** Gemini Scribe also supports [Ollama](https://ollama.com) — install Ollama, pull a model with `ollama pull llama3.2`, add the Ollama card in **Settings → Providers**, and route Chat to it on the **Features** page — and **OpenAI** — add the OpenAI card with your API key to run chat or GPT Image generation, and optionally point its base URL at an OpenAI-compatible server like LM Studio or MLX — and **Anthropic** — add your Anthropic API key on the Anthropic card to run Claude. Google Search, Google Maps, URL Context, Deep Research, and RAG remain Gemini-only, but you can route those individually to Gemini while chat or image generation uses another provider. Nothing is sent to the cloud unless you route it there. See [docs/guide/ollama-setup.md](docs/guide/ollama-setup.md), [docs/guide/openai-setup.md](docs/guide/openai-setup.md), and [docs/guide/anthropic-setup.md](docs/guide/anthropic-setup.md) for details.

## Installation

**Requires Obsidian 1.13.1 or later** — the settings tab is built on Obsidian's declarative settings API.

1.  **Community Plugins (Recommended):**
    - Open Obsidian Settings.
    - Navigate to "Community plugins".
    - Ensure "Restricted mode" is OFF.
    - Click "Browse" and search for "Gemini Scribe".
    - Click "Install" and then "Enable".

2.  **Manual Installation:**
    - Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/allenhutchison/obsidian-gemini/releases) page (you'll need `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`).
    - Create a folder named `gemini-scribe` inside your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` directory.
    - Copy the downloaded files into the `gemini-scribe` folder.
    - In Obsidian, go to Settings → Community plugins and enable "Gemini Scribe".

## Configuration

1.  **Obtain a Gemini API Key:**
    - Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    - Create a new API key.

2.  **Configure Plugin Settings:**
    - Open Obsidian Settings.
    - Go to "Gemini Scribe" under "Community plugins".
    - **Providers:** One connection card per account/endpoint. Add the Gemini card (paste your API key — stored securely via Obsidian's SecretStorage), the Ollama card (base URL, default `http://localhost:11434`), the OpenAI card (API key or a compatible-server base URL), and/or the Anthropic card (API key). Each card shows its available models with a Refresh button, a read-only "Used by" line, and — for Gemini — an "Includes" line for provider-bound extras (Google Maps grounding, page fetch by URL). Set a **Default provider** for any feature you haven't routed elsewhere.
    - **Features:** Route each feature — Chat and agent, Summaries, Completions, Rewrite, Web search, Deep research, Vault search index, Image generation — to a provider and model. Each row shows "provider · model"; opening it gives exactly two controls (provider, then model filtered to that provider). A feature can be set to **Off**, and a feature routed to a provider that can't serve it (or isn't connected) shows a warning and stays off — the plugin never falls back to another provider on its own.
    - **Your name:** Enter your name, which the AI will use when addressing you.
    - **Keep session history:** Toggle whether to save agent session history.
    - **Review a diff before files are written:** Open a diff view automatically when the agent proposes file changes.
    - **Vault search index:** Semantic search over your vault using Google File Search — its own sub-page (index toggle, rescan/delete, sync and attachment options, excluded folders).
    - **Plugin folder:** Choose the folder within your vault to store plugin data (agent sessions, custom prompts, and so on).
    - **Automation:** Scheduled tasks, Lifecycle hooks, and MCP servers each get their own sub-page for managing entries, plus one persistent toggle each (auto-run missed tasks, enable hooks).
    - **Tool permissions:** A single searchable list of every tool with filter pills (All/Read/Write/Destructive/External/MCP), fronted by a permission preset dropdown.
    - **Advanced:** Context compaction threshold, stop-on-tool-error, summary frontmatter key, tool-call logging, and a Diagnostics group (debug mode, token usage display, log-to-file).
    - **Documentation:** Opens this documentation site.
    - **Custom Prompts:**
      - **System Prompt Override:** Set `override_system_prompt: true` in a custom prompt's frontmatter to replace the built-in system instructions. There is no global toggle. See the [Custom Prompts Guide](docs/guide/custom-prompts.md#system-prompt-override).

## Usage

### Agent mode

Let the AI actively work with your vault through tool calling capabilities.

**Quick Start:**

1. Open Agent Chat with the command palette or ribbon icon
2. Ask the agent to help with vault operations
3. Review and approve actions (if confirmation is enabled)

**Available Tools:**

- **Search Files by Name:** Find any file by filename patterns (wildcards supported)
- **Search File Contents:** Grep-style text search within note contents (supports regex and case-sensitive search)
- **Read Files:** Access text files or analyze binary files directly through the chat model (images and SVG on every provider, PDF on Gemini and Anthropic, audio and video on Gemini) — SVGs are rasterized to PNG on-device so vector artwork and handwritten ink can be viewed and OCR'd
- **Create Notes:** Generate new notes with specified content
- **Edit Notes:** Modify existing notes with precision
- **Move/Rename Files:** Reorganize and rename notes in your vault
- **Delete Notes:** Remove notes or folders (with confirmation)
- **Create Folders:** Organize your vault with new folder structures
- **List Files:** Browse vault directories and their contents
- **Web Search:** Search Google for current information (if enabled)
- **Google Maps:** Look up real-world places, addresses, opening hours, and ratings grounded in Google Maps (Gemini provider only)
- **Fetch URLs:** Retrieve and analyze web content
- **Deep Research:** Conduct comprehensive multi-source research with citations

3.  **View Result:** The summary is added to your note's frontmatter (default key: `summary`)

**Tip:** Great for creating quick overviews of long notes or generating descriptions for note indexes.

### Selection-Based Text Rewriting

Precisely rewrite any portion of your text with AI assistance. This feature provides surgical precision for improving specific sections without affecting the rest of your document.

1.  **Select Text:** Highlight the text you want to rewrite in any Markdown file.
2.  **Access Rewrite Options:**
    - **Right-click method:** Right-click the selected text and choose "Gemini Scribe: Rewrite text..."
    - **Command method:** Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P) and search for "Rewrite text with AI"
3.  **Provide Instructions:** A modal will appear showing your selected text. Enter instructions for how you'd like it rewritten (e.g., "Make this more concise", "Fix grammar", "Make it more formal").
4.  **Review and Apply:** The AI will rewrite only your selected text based on your instructions, maintaining consistency with the surrounding content.

**Examples of rewrite instructions:**

- "Make this more concise"
- "Fix grammar and spelling"
- "Make it more formal/casual"
- "Expand with more detail"
- "Simplify the language"
- "Make it more technical"

**Benefits:**

- **Precise control:** Only rewrites what you select
- **Context-aware:** Maintains consistency with surrounding text and linked documents
- **Safe:** No risk of accidentally modifying your entire document
- **Intuitive:** Natural text editing workflow

### IDE-Style Completions

1.  **Toggle Completions:** Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P) and select "Gemini Scribe: Toggle completions". A notice will confirm whether completions are enabled or disabled. The toggle isn't saved — completions start off each time Obsidian starts or the plugin reloads.
2.  **Write:** Begin typing in a Markdown file.
3.  **Suggestions:** After a short pause in typing (500ms), Gemini will provide an inline suggestion based on your current context.
4.  **Accept/Dismiss:**
    - Press `Tab` to accept the suggestion.
    - Press any other key to dismiss the suggestion and continue typing.
5.  **Context-Aware:** Each suggestion is based on the whole current note — the text before and after the cursor.

### Chat History

- **Sessions in your vault:** Agent sessions are stored as markdown files under `[Plugin state folder]/Agent-Sessions/`, making them easy to browse, back up, and version-control.
- **Browse and resume:** Open the session menu (☰) in the agent header → **Browse sessions** (or run "Browse agent sessions") to load a previous session and continue the conversation.
- **Delete:** In **Browse sessions**, click a session's trash icon and confirm with the inline **Delete** button. Sessions are also plain markdown, so you can delete the files in `Agent-Sessions/` directly. There is no in-app "clear all" command.
- **Automatic management:** The plugin automatically:
  - Creates a session file the first time you send a message
  - Adds a YYYY-MM-DD prefix and an AI-generated description to the session title after the first exchange
  - Tracks every file the agent reads or writes in `accessed_files` frontmatter for audit and recall

### Custom Prompts

Create reusable AI instruction templates that customize how the AI behaves for specific sessions.

1. **Create New Prompts:**
   - Use the command palette: "Gemini Scribe: Create new custom prompt"
   - Enter a name and edit the generated template
   - Or manually create `.md` files in `[Plugin state folder]/Prompts/`

2. **Apply to Sessions:**
   - Open the agent panel and click the gear icon in the session header
   - Select your prompt from the "Prompt template" dropdown
   - The prompt applies to all messages in that session

**Tip:** See the comprehensive [Custom Prompts Guide](docs/guide/custom-prompts.md) for examples and best practices.

## Localization

The plugin UI follows **Obsidian's interface language** (Settings → About → Language) — there is no separate plugin language setting. AI responses are generated in your Obsidian language, and the plugin's own UI — settings tabs, modals, the agent panel, command palette entries, and notices — is translated as well.

**Non-English UI text is AI-translated** (bootstrapped with Gemini) and shipped in 20 languages: Czech, Danish, German, Spanish, French, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, and Chinese (Simplified and Traditional). Native speakers: refinement PRs are very welcome — just edit the strings in [`src/i18n/<language>.ts`](src/i18n/). Hand-refined translations are preserved when translations are regenerated; a string is only re-translated when its English source changes.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Errors:** Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions. Get a new key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
- **No Responses:** Check your internet connection and make sure your API key is valid.
- **Slow Responses:** The speed of responses depends on the Gemini model and the complexity of your request. Larger context windows will take longer.
- **Completions Not Showing:**
  - Ensure completions are enabled via the command palette
  - Try typing a few words and pausing to trigger the suggestion
  - Check that you're in a Markdown file
  - Disable other completion plugins that might conflict
- **Sessions Not Loading:** Ensure "Keep session history" is on and the "Plugin folder" path is correct. Sessions live under `[Plugin state folder]/Agent-Sessions/`.
- **Custom Prompts Not Working:**
  - Verify the prompt file exists in the `[Plugin state folder]/Prompts/` folder
  - Check that the prompt is selected in session settings (gear icon)
  - See the [Custom Prompts Guide](docs/guide/custom-prompts.md) for detailed troubleshooting
- **Model List Issues:**
  - Open the provider's card under **Settings → Providers** and click **Refresh** to re-query its model list
  - Restart Obsidian to trigger a fresh model list fetch (for Gemini)
  - Check that the provider's card shows "Connected" — a missing key or unreachable Ollama/OpenAI endpoint is why a feature shows a warning on the Features page
  - See the [Settings Reference](docs/reference/settings.md) for detailed configuration help
- **Agent mode / Tool Issues:**
  - Verify your Gemini model supports function calling (all Gemini 2.0+ models do)
  - If tools fail, check file permissions and paths
  - System folders (plugin state folder, .obsidian) are protected from modifications
  - For session issues, try creating a new session from the chat interface
  - Check the console (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I) or enable "Log API calls to a file" under **Advanced → Diagnostics** and review `debug.log` in the plugin state folder for detailed error messages
  - Tool loop detection (fixed at 3 identical calls within 30 seconds) may stop repeated operations — it is not configurable
