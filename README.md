> **Note:** Pick one of two setup paths in plugin settings → **Provider**:
>
> - **Google Gemini (cloud)** — requires a Gemini API key (free tier available at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)).
> - **Ollama (local)** — runs locally with no API key; install [Ollama](https://ollama.com), pull a model, and select it in settings. See [docs/guide/ollama-setup.md](docs/guide/ollama-setup.md) for the feature-parity table.

## What's New in v4.10.2 (Opt Edition)

**🛠️ Gemini Scribe 4.10.2 - Interactions API transport fix, recoverable deletes & AI Optimizations**

- **⚡ Parallel Tool Execution** - Independent, non-modifying read and search tools run concurrently in parallel, reducing latency in agent turns.
- **💾 Context Caching** - Automatically caches conversation history prefix for sessions exceeding `32,768` tokens, dramatically reducing token costs and response latency for long chats.
- **📂 Files API Uploads** - Uploads audio, video, PDF, and image attachments to Google's hosted Files API once per session, avoiding repeated base64 payloads across follow-up turns. Fallbacks to base64 if custom endpoints do not support it.
- **🧪 Interactions API transport fixed** - With **Use Interactions API** enabled, every request failed with a CORS error ("Failed to fetch") after the Gemini SDK update to `@google/genai` 2.10.0, breaking chat and summarization for anyone who had the opt-in transport on. Requests now route through Obsidian's `requestUrl` again, so the Interactions path works. The transport remains off by default.
- **🗑️ Safer file deletion** - When the agent deletes a file or folder it now follows your Obsidian "Deleted files" setting (system trash or the vault's `.trash` folder) instead of permanently removing it, so deletions are recoverable; includes minor correctness fixes.

_The full 4.10 feature set is unchanged:_

- **🌍 Localized UI in 20 languages** - The entire plugin interface (settings, modals, agent view, commands, notices) is now translated, auto-selected from your Obsidian language with graceful fallback to English.
- **🧠 Model reasoning display** - The agent shows the model's thinking inline in the tool activity block and persists it in session history, so you can follow how it reached an answer.
- **🧪 Interactions API transport (experimental, opt-in)** - New **Use Interactions API** setting routes Gemini chat through Google's newer Interactions API, with full streaming of text, reasoning, tool calls, and grounded sources. Off by default and runs statelessly (your conversation history stays on your device); enable it under **Settings → Agent config → API configuration**, or leave it off to keep using the proven `generateContent` path.
- **🗺️ Google Maps grounding tool** - The agent can ground answers in Google Maps data for place and location questions.
- **🧠 Per-use-case thinking depth** - Reasoning effort is now tuned per task (completions think the least, agent chat the most) instead of one global setting, balancing latency and quality.
- **⏳ Soft agent turn budget** - Long agent runs get a gentle reminder as they approach the turn limit, plus a one-shot extension, instead of stopping abruptly.
- **📋 Copy buttons for tool calls** - Quickly copy tool-call parameters and results from the agent view.
- **🔄 In-app model-list refresh** - Refresh the available Gemini model list without restarting.

**Previous Updates (v4.10.1):**

- **📝 Notes-only patch** - Completed the 4.10.0 release notes (which omitted several of the features above); no functional changes.

**Previous Updates (v4.9.1):**

- **🗂️ Initialize vault context fix** - Fixed the "Initialize vault context" / "Update vault context" button, which was sending a malformed model request and failing to generate AGENTS.md. The feature now works correctly.

**Previous Updates (v4.9.0):**

**🪝 Gemini Scribe 4.9 - Lifecycle Hooks, Stable Prefix Caching, Custom Endpoint**

- **🪝 Lifecycle hooks** - Trigger headless AI agent runs in response to vault events (file created, modified, deleted, renamed). Create and manage hooks from the **Open hook manager** command. See the [Lifecycle Hooks guide](docs/guide/lifecycle-hooks.md).
- **⚡ Stable prefix caching** - The agent's system instruction is now byte-stable across turns and tool follow-ups, restoring Gemini's implicit prefix cache so long sessions stop reprocessing history each turn.
- **🌐 Custom API endpoint** - New setting to route all Gemini API calls through a proxy or alternate endpoint, covering every SDK call site.
- **📐 Collapsible settings sections** - Settings page reorganized into foldable sections for a cleaner UI.
- **🔐 MCP hardening** - Stdio server environment variables now live in Obsidian's encrypted SecretStorage; offline or unreachable MCP servers no longer block plugin load.
- **🛡️ Unified tool-policy** - Sessions, Projects, Scheduled tasks, and Hooks now share one policy model so per-feature permissions behave consistently.
- **📦 Two-phase context compaction** - Long conversations truncate older tool-result payloads first, summarize second, for cleaner handling near the token limit.

**Previous Updates (v4.8.0):**

- **⏰ Scheduled tasks** - Run agent tasks on a cron, time-of-day, or day-of-week schedule with full management UI. See the [Scheduled tasks guide](docs/guide/scheduled-tasks.md).
- **🌙 Missed-run catch-up** - Tasks that should have run while Obsidian was closed surface on startup for review.
- **🛰️ Background tasks** - Deep research and image generation now run in the background with output consolidated under `[state-folder]/Background-Tasks/`. See the [Background tasks guide](docs/guide/background-tasks.md).
- **🦙 Ollama provider** - Point the plugin at a local Ollama server for offline, local-model chat. See the [Ollama Setup guide](docs/guide/ollama-setup.md).
- **🛑 Runaway-loop abort** - Repeated tool-loop detections within a turn now abort the turn with a clear notice instead of churning.
- **🛠️ Headless agent loop** - AgentLoop extracted from the agent view so scheduled and background runners share the same execution engine.

## Features

- **Agent mode with Tool Calling:** An AI agent that can actively work with your vault! It can search for files, read content, create new notes, edit existing ones, move and rename files, create folders, and even conduct deep research with proper citations. Features persistent sessions, granular permission controls, session-specific model configuration, a diff review view that lets you inspect and edit proposed file changes before they're written, and **Plan Mode** — an opt-in UI affordance that generates a step-by-step plan for your approval before the agent acts.
- **Parallel Tool Execution**: Execute independent read-only or search tools concurrently (e.g., file reads, search queries) in parallel to significantly reduce latency during multi-step agent runs, while state-modifying tools execute sequentially to avoid write race conditions.
- **Context Caching**: Automatically cache conversation history prefix using Google's Context Caching when session size exceeds `32,768` tokens, lowering token usage costs and improving response speed for long chat sessions.
- **Files API Uploads**: Securely upload large binary attachments (images, audio, video, PDFs) to Gemini's hosted Files API once per session, referencing them via lightweight URIs in subsequent turns to prevent repeated base64 payload overhead. Supports graceful fallback to base64 inline mode.
- **Semantic Vault Search:** Search your vault by meaning, not just keywords. Uses Google's File Search API to index your notes in the background. The AI can find relevant content even when you don't remember exact words. Supports PDFs and attachments, with pause/resume controls and detailed status tracking.
- **Context-Aware Agent:** Add specific notes as persistent context for your agent sessions. The agent can access and reference these context files throughout your conversation, providing highly relevant and personalized responses.
- **Smart Summarization:** Quickly generate concise, one-sentence summaries of your notes and automatically store them in the document's frontmatter, using a dedicated Gemini model optimized for summarization.
- **Selection-Based AI Features:** Work with selected text in powerful ways:
  - **Rewrite**: Transform selected text with custom instructions - right-click and choose "Gemini Scribe: Rewrite text..."
  - **Explain Selection**: Get AI explanations using customizable prompts - right-click and choose "Gemini Scribe: Apply prompt..."
  - **Ask about selection**: Ask any question about selected text - right-click and choose "Gemini Scribe: Ask question..."
- **IDE-Style Completions:** Get real-time, context-aware text completions as you type, similar to IDEs. Accept completions with `Tab` or dismiss with any other key. This feature uses a dedicated Gemini model for optimized completion generation.
- **Persistent Agent sessions:** Store your agent conversation history directly in your vault as markdown files. Each session is stored in the `gemini-scribe/Agent-Sessions/` folder, making it easy to backup, version control, and continue conversations across sessions.
- **Configurable Models:** Choose different Gemini models for chat, summarization, and completions, allowing you to tailor the AI's behavior to each task.
- **Custom Prompt System:** Create reusable AI instruction templates for agent sessions, allowing you to customize the AI's behavior for different workflows (e.g., technical documentation, creative writing, research). Includes command palette commands for easy creation and management.
- **Image Paste Support:** Paste images directly into the chat input to send them to Gemini for multimodal analysis. Images are automatically saved to your Obsidian attachment folder, displayed as thumbnails before sending, and the AI receives the image path for embedding in notes.
- **MCP Server Support:** [Experimental] Connect to [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers to extend the agent with external tools. Supports stdio (desktop) and HTTP transports (all platforms including mobile), with OAuth authentication for remote servers. Configure per-tool trust settings with seamless integration into the confirmation flow.
- **Scheduled tasks:** Automate recurring AI prompts — daily summaries, weekly reports, periodic vault maintenance — without manual intervention. Create and manage tasks from the **Open scheduler** command or Settings → Gemini Scribe → Automation. Each task has a frontmatter schedule (`daily`, `daily@HH:MM`, `weekly`, `weekly@HH:MM:DAYS`, `interval:Xm`, etc.) and a prompt body; tasks run as headless agent sessions and write output to your vault. Supports per-task model and tool-category overrides, a configurable tool-iteration cap (`maxIterations`, default 20) for long multi-step runs, catch-up runs for tasks missed while Obsidian was closed (`runIfMissed: true`), automatic pause after repeated failures, and a task monitor via the command palette.
- **Lifecycle Hooks:** [Opt-in] Trigger headless AI agent runs in response to vault events — file created, modified, deleted, or renamed. Create and manage hooks from the **Open hook manager** command or Settings → Gemini Scribe → Automation. Each hook specifies a trigger, an optional path glob and frontmatter filter, and a prompt template; runs include debounce, per-hour rate limits, cooldown, a configurable tool-iteration cap (`maxIterations`, default 20), and auto-pause guards to keep API costs in check. Requires enabling the `hooksEnabled` setting.
- **Projects:** Create scoped agent profiles for different areas of your vault. A project bundles custom instructions, file scope, skill selection, and permission overrides into a single configuration. The agent auto-detects projects from your folder structure and applies project-specific behavior — including scoped file discovery, filtered skills, and per-tool permission overrides. See the [Projects guide](https://allenhutchison.github.io/obsidian-gemini/guide/projects) for details and the [blog post](https://allen.hutchison.org/2026/04/09/scoping-ai-context-with-projects-in-gemini-scribe/) for a walkthrough.
- **Agent Skills:** Create, edit, and use extensible skill packages that give the agent specialized knowledge and workflows. Skills follow the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification and are stored in your plugin state folder. The agent automatically discovers available skills and activates them on demand. Update existing skills via the `edit_skill` tool with diff review.
- **Built-in Prompt templates:** The plugin uses carefully crafted Handlebars templates for system prompts, agent prompts, summarization prompts, selection rewrite prompts, and completion prompts. These ensure consistent and effective AI interaction.
- **Data Privacy:** All interactions with the Gemini API are done directly from your machine. No data is sent to any third-party servers other than Google's. Agent session history is stored locally in your Obsidian vault as markdown files.
- **Robust Session Management:**
  - Persistent agent sessions that survive restarts
  - Session-specific permissions and settings
  - Context files that persist across the session
  - Full conversation history with tool execution logs
  - Easy backup and version control of sessions
  - Automatic context compaction when conversations grow large
  - Optional token usage display showing real-time context consumption

    - Press any other key to dismiss the suggestion and continue typing.
5.  **Context-Aware:** Completions consider the surrounding text and document structure for more relevant suggestions.

### Chat History

- **Sessions in your vault:** Agent sessions are stored as markdown files under `[Plugin state folder]/Agent-Sessions/`, making them easy to browse, back up, and version-control.
- **Browse and resume:** Use the session dropdown in the agent panel to load a previous session and continue the conversation.
- **Manual management:** Sessions are plain markdown — delete the files in `Agent-Sessions/` to remove old conversations. There is no in-app "clear all" command.
- **Automatic management:** The plugin automatically:
  - Creates a session file the first time you send a message
  - Adds a YYYY-MM-DD prefix and an AI-generated description to the session title after the first exchange
  - Tracks every file the agent reads or writes in `accessed_files` frontmatter for audit and recall

### Custom Prompts

Create reusable AI instruction templates that customize how the AI behaves for specific sessions.

1. **Create New Prompts:**
   - Use the command palette: "Gemini Scribe: Create new custom prompt"
   - Enter a name and edit the generated template
   - Or manually create `.md` files in `[Plugin state folder]/Prompts/`

2. **Apply to Sessions:**
   - Open the agent panel and click the gear icon in the session header
   - Select your prompt from the "Prompt template" dropdown
   - The prompt applies to all messages in that session

**Tip:** See the comprehensive [Custom Prompts Guide](docs/guide/custom-prompts.md) for examples and best practices.

## Localization

The plugin UI follows **Obsidian's interface language** (Settings → About → Language) — there is no separate plugin language setting. AI responses are generated in your Obsidian language, and the plugin's own UI — settings tabs, modals, the agent panel, command palette entries, and notices — is translated as well.

**Non-English UI text is AI-translated** (bootstrapped with Gemini) and shipped in 20 languages: Czech, Danish, German, Spanish, French, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, and Chinese (Simplified and Traditional). Native speakers: refinement PRs are very welcome — just edit the strings in [`src/i18n/<language>.ts`](src/i18n/). Hand-refined translations are preserved when translations are regenerated; a string is only re-translated when its English source changes.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Errors:** Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions. Get a new key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
- **No Responses:** Check your internet connection and make sure your API key is valid.
- **Slow Responses:** The speed of responses depends on the Gemini model and the complexity of your request. Larger context windows will take longer.
- **Completions Not Showing:**
  - Ensure completions are enabled via the command palette
  - Try typing a few words and pausing to trigger the suggestion
  - Check that you're in a Markdown file
  - Disable other completion plugins that might conflict
- **Sessions Not Loading:** Ensure "Enable session history" is on and the "Plugin state folder" path is correct. Sessions live under `[Plugin state folder]/Agent-Sessions/`.
- **Custom Prompts Not Working:**
  - Verify the prompt file exists in the `[Plugin state folder]/Prompts/` folder
  - Check that the prompt is selected in session settings (gear icon)
  - See the [Custom Prompts Guide](docs/guide/custom-prompts.md) for detailed troubleshooting
- **Parameter/Advanced Settings Issues:**
  - Check if your model supports the temperature range you're using
  - Reset temperature and Top P to defaults if getting unexpected responses
  - Restart Obsidian to trigger a fresh model list fetch (for Gemini), or click **Refresh model list** (for Ollama)
  - See the [Advanced Settings Guide](docs/reference/advanced-settings.md) for detailed configuration help
- **Agent mode / Tool Issues:**
  - Verify your Gemini model supports function calling (all Gemini 2.0+ models do)
  - If tools fail, check file permissions and paths
  - System folders (plugin state folder, .obsidian) are protected from modifications
  - For session issues, try creating a new session from the chat interface
  - Check the console (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I) or enable "Log to file" in settings and review `debug.log` in the plugin state folder for detailed error messages
  - Tool loop detection may stop repeated operations - adjust settings if needed
