# Repository Guidelines

## Project Overview

Obsidian Gemini Scribe is an Obsidian plugin that integrates Google's Gemini AI models for AI-driven assistance within Obsidian. It provides context-aware chat, document summarization, text rewriting, and IDE-style completions.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/` contains TypeScript plugin code; `src/main.ts` is the entry point with domain folders such as `agent/`, `api/`, `tools/`, `ui/`, and `services/`, plus shared utilities in `utils/`.
- `docs/` hosts user and operator guides; `prompts/` ships default agent prompts; `test-scripts/` holds manual integration runners.
- Unit tests live in the `test/` directory mirroring `src/` structure as `*.test.ts`; generated artifacts (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`) stay in the repo root for Obsidian.

## Commands

### Development

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Development build with watch mode
npm run build        # Production build (generates refs, runs TypeScript check, then bundles)
npm run generate-refs # Regenerate help references from docs/ (runs automatically in build/dev)
npm test             # Run Vitest tests
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run format-check # Check formatting without changes
npm run lint         # Lint with ESLint (eslint-plugin-obsidianmd recommended preset)
npm run lint:fix     # Auto-fix ESLint violations where possible
npm run lint:cycles  # Fail on circular imports (madge --circular over src/; baseline is 0 and CI's lint workflow enforces it)
npm run knip         # Detect unused files, exports, types, and dependencies (configured in knip.json)
npm run install:test-vault # Copy built artifacts into test vault. Target precedence: TEST_VAULT_PLUGIN_DIR (exact plugin folder, validated by id) > TEST_VAULT_DIR (vault root, scanned by id) > default ~/Obsidian/Test Vault
npm run translate    # Regenerate AI translations in src/i18n/ (needs GOOGLE_API_KEY; not part of build/test — runs in its own `Update UI translations` workflow on en.ts changes, or manually)
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always run `npm install` first if you encounter TypeScript errors or missing module errors during build. The build requires all dependencies in `node_modules` to be present. If you get errors about missing modules like `obsidian`, `@google/genai`, `handlebars`, or `tslib`, run `npm install` before attempting `npm run build` again.

### Testing

- Run single test: `npm test -- path/to/test.ts`
- Manual integration: `node test-scripts/test-sdk-tools.mjs` (and siblings) validate agent toolchains before shipping
- **Typecheck test files before pushing test changes**: the CI lint job runs `npm run typecheck:test` (`tsc --project tsconfig.test.json`), which type-checks the `test/` tree and catches errors the production build misses — `npm run build` uses `tsc -skipLibCheck` and excludes tests. A green local `npm run build` does **not** guarantee CI passes; run `npm run typecheck:test` too. (Classic trap: an expression-bodied arrow like `(t) => arr.push(t)` returns `number`, not `void`, and only the test typecheck flags it.)

### Versioning & Releases

For the full release process, use the **release** skill (from the maintainerd plugin; the
repo-specific release gates live in `.claude/guidelines/release.md`).

## Architecture

### Core Pattern: Factory + Decorator

```
src/main.ts → ModelClientFactory.createFromPlugin() → GeminiClient | OllamaClient → RetryDecorator → ModelApi
```

The plugin uses a factory pattern (`ModelClientFactory` in `src/api/factory.ts`) to create model API clients, wrapped with a retry decorator (`RetryDecorator`) for resilience. The factory branches on `settings.provider` to instantiate either a `GeminiClient` or an `OllamaClient`. All API implementations follow the `ModelApi` interface. The factory supports different use cases (chat, summary, completions, rewrite) and provides retry logic with exponential backoff for handling transient API failures. Each provider lives in its own package under `src/api/providers/{gemini,ollama}/`.

### Key Components

1. **API Layer** (`src/api/`): Factory pattern (`ModelClientFactory`) for creating provider-appropriate model API clients, decorator pattern (`RetryDecorator`) for resilience, and interface abstraction (`ModelApi`) for consistent API interactions. Provider-specific code is encapsulated under `src/api/providers/{gemini,ollama}/`.
2. **Feature Modules**: Separate modules for chat, completions (`completions.ts`), summary (`summary.ts`), and rewrite (`rewrite.ts`)
3. **Context System** (`src/files/file-context.ts`): Builds linked note trees for context-aware AI interactions
4. **History** (`src/history/`): Markdown-based conversation history with Handlebars templates for agent sessions, stored in `[state-folder]/Agent-Sessions/` (legacy note-centric chat history from v3.x remains in `[state-folder]/History/`)
   - **Reasoning persistence**: model "thinking" is stored on `GeminiConversationEntry.thoughts` and serialized as a collapsed `> [!reasoning]-` callout. Turns with a message (user prompt, final answer) carry a `## ` header + Message Info table; streamlined reasoning-only turns are just the bare `[!reasoning]` callout with no header. **Parser invariant** (`SessionHistory.parseHistoryContent`): entries are identified by their _callout_ (`[!user]`/`[!assistant]`/`[!reasoning]`), not a `## ` header, and the parser walks **every** callout in a `---`-delimited section (reasoning + tool callouts flow together with no dividers). This keeps the divider-free activity stream, headerless reasoning, and legacy per-entry files all round-tripping — preserve it, and cover format changes with old-format fixtures in `test/agent/session-history.test.ts`.
5. **Custom Prompts** (`src/prompts/`): User-defined prompt templates stored in `[state-folder]/Prompts/`
6. **Agent mode** (`src/agent/`, `src/tools/`): AI agent with tool calling capabilities
   - Session management with persistent history
   - Tool registry and execution engine
   - Vault operations tools with permission system
   - Google Search integration (separate from function calling)
   - Web fetch tool using Google's URL Context API
   - Session-level permission system for bypassing confirmations
   - Tool loop detection to prevent infinite execution cycles
   - MCP server integration with stdio and HTTP/SSE transports (`src/mcp/`)
   - Agent skills system for extensible AI capabilities (see below)
   - **`AgentLoop`** (`src/agent/agent-loop.ts`) — UI-agnostic class that drives the tool-execution loop after the initial model response. Handles iteration, history construction (via pure helpers in `agent-loop-helpers.ts`), follow-up requests, empty-response retry, cancellation polling, and `agentEventBus` emissions. UI side effects flow through optional `AgentLoopHooks` (`onToolBatchStart`, `onToolCallStart`, `onToolCallComplete`, `onToolCounted`, `onFollowUpRequestStart`, `onEmptyResponseRetry`, `onModelReasoning`, `onBudgetUpdate`, `onFollowUpChunk`, `onFollowUpStreamReady`, `onMidLoopCompaction`). `onModelReasoning` fires when an intermediate follow-up response carries model reasoning but continues to another tool batch (the "why I'm calling these tools" thinking); the terminal response's reasoning is returned on `AgentLoopResult.thoughts` instead. `onFollowUpStreamReady` fires on the streaming follow-up path with the live `StreamingResponse` when it starts and with `null` once it settles, so the UI can register it in the same `currentStreamingResponse` slot the Stop button cancels — letting Stop halt a mid-stream follow-up immediately instead of waiting for `stream.complete` (see #1054). The agent view renders both into the tool activity block, interleaved with tool rows. After every tool batch, `AgentLoop` calls `ContextManager.prepareHistory` with `protectFromIndex` pinned to the start of the current turn's tool-loop turns, so long tool chains can be compacted mid-flight without ever folding the in-flight `functionCall`/`thoughtSignature` continuity into a summary (only turns from before the loop started are eligible); `onMidLoopCompaction` fires when that happens so the UI can surface the same "Context Compacted" notice as the pre-turn path (see #662). Callers own: the initial API call, persisting the final response (UI saves to session history; headless callers may write a file), and any UI rendering. `AgentLoopOptions.confirmationProvider` is required — UI callers pass the `AgentView` (which implements `IConfirmationProvider`), headless callers pass an auto-approve/deny provider; the engine never looks it up on the plugin. The agent view (`AgentViewTools`) is a thin adapter over this loop. Headless callers (e.g. scheduled-task runners) should consume `AgentLoop` rather than reimplementing the loop. The lazy `require('./agent-factory')` inside `AgentLoop.run` is a deliberate pattern to break the import cycle between `AgentFactory` and the loop — keep top-level imports unless a cycle forces it.
7. **Attachment Pipeline** (`src/ui/agent-view/agent-view.ts`, `src/ui/agent-view/agent-view-ui.ts`, `src/ui/agent-view/inline-attachment.ts`, `src/utils/file-classification.ts`): Unified drag-and-drop and paste pipeline for file attachments
   - Files dropped or pasted into the agent view are classified by extension using `classifyFile()` from `file-classification.ts`
   - **Text files** (`.md`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.base`, `.canvas`, etc.) → context chips (AI reads content)
   - **Gemini-supported binary files** (images, audio, video, PDF) → base64 inline attachments sent to the model via `inlineAttachments` on `ExtendedModelRequest`
   - **Unsupported files** (`.zip`, `.exe`, etc.) → user notification
   - Cumulative 20 MB size limit enforced across vault drops, external drops, and paste
   - Folder drops recursively expand and classify all contained files
   - `InlineAttachment` (renamed from `ImageAttachment`) holds base64 data, MIME type, and optional vault path
   - Image attachments show thumbnails; non-image attachments show Lucide icon + filename label
   - **Binary file awareness in tools**: `ReadFileTool` uses `classifyFile()` to detect binary files and reads them via `vault.readBinary()`, returning `inlineData` on `ToolResult`. The tool execution pipeline (`agent-view-tools.ts`) injects these as `inlineData` parts alongside `functionResponse` in conversation history. This allows the agent to autonomously read images, audio, video, and PDFs encountered via tools without manual drag-and-drop.
   - `OBSIDIAN_TEXT_EXTENSIONS` map in `file-classification.ts` classifies `.base` and `.canvas` as text

### Model Configuration

- Models defined in `src/models.ts` with automatic version migration
- Different models for different tasks (chat, summary, completions, rewrite)
- Settings changes trigger full plugin reload

### Important Patterns

1. **Obsidian API First**: Always use built-in Obsidian API functions when available instead of low-level operations (for detailed Obsidian API guidance, use the **obsidian-plugin-development** skill):
   - Use `vault.getMarkdownFiles()` instead of `vault.adapter.list()`
   - Use `app.fileManager.processFrontMatter()` for frontmatter manipulation
   - Use `vault.getAbstractFileByPath()` for file operations
   - Use `app.metadataCache` for file metadata access
   - Use `app.fileManager.renameFile()` for renaming files (preserves metadata)
   - Use `app.workspace.openLinkText()` for clickable file links in views
2. **File Operations**: Always use Obsidian's normalized paths and metadata cache
3. **Error Handling**: API calls wrapped with retry logic and exponential backoff
4. **Prompts**: Handlebars templates in `prompts/` directory, loaded as text files
5. **Debouncing**: Completions use a 500ms debounce (the `codemirror-companion-extension` default; the plugin doesn't override `delay`) to prevent excessive API calls
6. **State Management**: Plugin instance holds all component references with proper cleanup
7. **Folder Structure**: Plugin uses structured state folder:
   - `[state-folder]/` - Main plugin state folder (default: `gemini-scribe`)
   - `[state-folder]/History/` - Legacy note-centric chat history files (v3.x)
   - `[state-folder]/Prompts/` - Custom prompt templates
   - `[state-folder]/Agent-Sessions/` - Agent mode session files
   - `[state-folder]/Skills/` - Agent skill packages (agentskills.io format)
   - `[state-folder]/Scheduled-Tasks/` - Scheduled task definitions and run output
   - `[state-folder]/Background-Tasks/` - Output from background deep-research and image-gen tasks
   - `[state-folder]/Hooks/` - Lifecycle hook definitions and run output (created when `hooksEnabled` is `true`)
   - Automatic migration for existing users from flat structure
8. **System Folder Protection**: Always exclude system folders from file operations:
   - The plugin state folder (`settings.historyFolder`)
   - The `.obsidian` configuration folder
   - Use exclusion checks in all vault operation tools
9. **Tool Execution Order**: When AI needs to perform multiple operations:
   - Always prioritize read operations before destructive operations
   - Sort tool calls to execute reads before writes/deletes
   - Prevents race conditions where files are deleted before being read
10. **Loop Detection**: Tool execution includes loop detection to prevent infinite cycles:

- Tracks identical tool calls within time windows
- Configurable thresholds and time windows
- Session-specific tracking with automatic cleanup
- Blocked calls are flagged with `loopDetected: true` on `ToolResult` and emit a `toolLoopDetected` event on the agent bus
- `AgentLoop` counts those fires per turn and aborts the turn after `AGENT_LOOP_ABORT_THRESHOLD` (currently 3) — the result comes back with `loopAborted: true` and a user-visible notice, which the UI displays but does not persist to session history

11. **Tool Implementation**: `ToolExecutionContext.plugin` is typed `ObsidianGemini`; no cast is needed in tool implementations — use `context.plugin` directly.

12. **YAML Frontmatter**: Agent instructions include guidance for respecting YAML frontmatter when modifying files

- The AI is trained to place "top of note" content after frontmatter blocks (defined in `prompts/agentRulesPrompt.hbs`)
- YAML frontmatter must start with `---` on line 1 and end with `---`
- Content is only placed before frontmatter when explicitly instructed to modify frontmatter

13. **Agent Skills** (`src/services/skill-manager.ts`, `src/tools/skill-tools.ts`): Extensible skill system following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) specification

- Skills are self-contained packages stored in `[state-folder]/Skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- `SkillManager` handles discovery, metadata parsing, content loading, resource reading, creation, and name validation
- Uses progressive disclosure: skill summaries (name + description) are injected into the agent system prompt; full instructions are loaded on-demand via `activate_skill`
- Three tools: `activate_skill` (read-only, loads instructions or resources), `create_skill` (creates new skill directories with valid SKILL.md), and `edit_skill` (updates an existing skill's description or instruction body, with diff-review confirmation)
- Skill names must be lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens, 1-64 chars, no consecutive/leading/trailing hyphens
- Frontmatter parsing uses Obsidian's native `metadataCache` API
- `scripts/` directories are treated as read-only reference material (no execution in Obsidian)
- **Bundled help references are auto-generated**: `scripts/generate-help-references.mjs` scans `docs/guide/` and `docs/reference/` to produce `src/services/generated-help-references.ts` at build time. Adding or removing a markdown file in those directories automatically updates the help skill — no manual edits to `bundled-skills.ts` or `SKILL.md` are needed.

14. **UI String Localization (i18n)** (`src/i18n/`): All static user-facing UI strings (settings, modals, agent view, command names, notices, tooltips) go through `t(key, vars?)` from `src/i18n/index.ts` — never hardcode user-visible English. Model-facing strings (prompts, tool descriptions), strings persisted to vault files (history callout markers, frontmatter), logger output, and strings compared with `===` stay English. `src/i18n/en.ts` is the source of truth (key → `{message, context}`); per-language files (`ru.ts`, `pt-br.ts`, …) are AI-generated by `npm run translate` (`scripts/translate.mjs`, needs `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) and committed. The script only retranslates keys whose English source hash changed (`src/i18n/translation-state.json`), so hand-refined translations survive regeneration. Locale comes from Obsidian's `getLanguage()` with exact → base-language → English fallback. When adding a UI string to a migrated area: add the key + context to `en.ts` and use `t()`. You can run `npm run translate` locally and commit the regenerated files, but you don't have to — the `Update UI translations` GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/i18n-translate.yml`) regenerates them automatically when `en.ts` lands on master (using the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` repo secret) and opens a `chore(i18n)` PR for review. It also runs weekly and can be dispatched manually. When adding a language: add a row to `LANGUAGES` in `scripts/translate.mjs`, register the export in `src/i18n/index.ts`, and run `npm run translate -- --langs <code>` (or trigger the workflow with that `langs` input).

15. **Plugin type surface — no imports of `main.ts`** (`src/types/plugin.ts`, `src/types/plugin-services.ts`): Components never reference the concrete plugin class — `import type { ObsidianGemini } from '../types/plugin'` (a leaf interface), never `import type ObsidianGemini from '../main'`. `main.ts` imports nearly the whole codebase, so a type reference back to it folds the module graph into hundreds of cycles (#1155). The interface declares only core members (`settings`, `apiKey`, `checkInitialized`, …); every service/manager handle (`logger`, `sessionManager`, …) is contributed by module augmentation in `src/types/plugin-services.ts` — an orphan, type-only module nothing imports (it participates via tsconfig `include`), which keeps `types/plugin.ts` a true leaf. When adding a service handle to the plugin class in `main.ts`, mirror it in `plugin-services.ts`; the class's `implements ObsidianGeminiApi` clause fails to compile until the two are in sync. More broadly, when a manager and a sibling module (runner, registry, UI section) need the same type or helper, put it in a leaf module both import (`services/hook-types.ts`, `services/skill-types.ts`, `ui/settings-helpers.ts`, `types/settings.ts`) instead of importing the manager back. The whole graph is kept acyclic by `npm run lint:cycles` (madge) in the lint CI workflow.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

For in-depth code quality standards (DRY, SOLID, error handling, performance, security), use the **code-review** skill.

- TypeScript-first codebase; group modules by domain and add barrel exports only when they simplify imports.
- Format with Prettier (`npm run format`): 2-space indent, 120-column width, semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas.
- Lint with ESLint (`npm run lint`, autofix with `npm run lint:fix`): the `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` recommended preset enforces Obsidian-specific best practices (memory-leak prevention, cross-window safety, command-ID conventions, manifest validation, etc.). Pervasive rules that need broader refactoring are temporarily disabled in `eslint.config.mjs` — see the `PERVASIVE_OBSIDIANMD_RULES_TODO` block for follow-up items. Runs in precommit (lint-staged, staged `*.ts` only) and CI (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`).
- `.editorconfig` enforces LF endings and tabbed Markdown/config; avoid hand-editing generated bundles.
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/types, and kebab-case filenames aligned with their feature area.
- Handle TypeScript errors properly - ensure all properties are correctly typed
- Use proper async/await patterns for all asynchronous operations

### Console Logging

The plugin uses a dedicated Logger service (`src/utils/logger.ts`) that respects the debug mode setting. This approach avoids global console patching, preventing conflicts with other plugins and Obsidian's debugging tools.

**Accessing the Logger:**

- Plugin components: `this.plugin.logger`
- Tool implementations: `context.plugin.logger` (via ToolExecutionContext)
- Utility functions: Accept logger as parameter

**Logger Methods:**

- **`logger.log()` and `logger.debug()`**: Only output when debug mode is enabled
  - Automatically filtered based on settings.debugMode
  - Prefixed with `[Gemini Scribe]` for easy identification

- **`logger.error()` and `logger.warn()`**: Always visible regardless of debug mode
  - Use for important errors and warnings that users should always see
  - Critical failures, API errors, and data integrity issues

**Best Practices:**

- Use `logger.log()` for debug information that helps development and troubleshooting
- Use `logger.error()` for errors that indicate something went wrong
- Use `logger.warn()` for warnings about deprecated features or potential issues
- Never use native `console.log()` or `console.debug()` directly
- Pass logger instance to utility functions that need logging

**Examples:**

```typescript
// ✅ Good - in plugin components
this.plugin.logger.log('Processing file:', file.path);
this.plugin.logger.debug('Tool execution context:', context);

// ✅ Good - in tool implementations
async execute(params: any, context: ToolExecutionContext) {
    const plugin = context.plugin;
    plugin.logger.log('Executing tool with params:', params);
}

// ✅ Good - in utility functions
export function processData(logger: Logger, data: any) {
    logger.log('Processing data:', data);
}

// ✅ Good - always visible for critical issues
this.plugin.logger.error('Failed to load API key:', error);
this.plugin.logger.warn('Model deprecated, using fallback');

// ❌ Bad - using console directly
console.log('Debug message');

// ❌ Bad - manual debug mode checks (logger handles this)
if (this.plugin.settings.debugMode) {
    this.plugin.logger.log('Debug message');
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Vitest (esbuild-powered) for TypeScript support
- jsdom environment for DOM testing
- Test pattern: `test/**/?(*.)+(spec|test).[tj]s`
- Keep unit tests next to implementations and name them after the unit (`models.test.ts`, `main.test.ts`)
- Assert observable behavior of prompts, services, and tool orchestration; add regression coverage for bugs
- Extend shared fixtures under `__mocks__/` when mocking new APIs
- Run `npm test` before each PR and execute relevant `test-scripts/*.mjs` after touching agent or tool code

For manual testing procedures (desktop symlink setup, mobile testing, smoke test checklists), see [docs/contributing/testing.md](docs/contributing/testing.md). For runtime debugging and plugin inspection, use the **obsidian-cli** skill.

### Testing Focus

When adding features, ensure tests cover:

- Core utility functions
- API error scenarios with retry behavior
- File context tree building and circular reference prevention
- Prompt generation with proper template rendering

## Development Practices

### Documentation Maintenance

**🚨 CRITICAL - DOCUMENTATION IS MANDATORY 🚨**

Documentation updates are **REQUIRED**, not optional. Every code change MUST include corresponding documentation updates in the same PR/commit.

**When making ANY change:**

1. **Feature Addition**:
   - Update README.md with new feature description
   - Create or update relevant user guides in `docs/`
   - Add examples and use cases
   - Update table of contents and navigation

2. **Feature Updates**:
   - Modify ALL affected documentation files
   - Update code examples to reflect changes
   - Revise screenshots or diagrams if needed

3. **Feature Removal**:
   - Remove or rewrite documentation for removed features
   - Delete archived docs (users auto-update, no need for old docs)
   - Update migration guides if needed

4. **API/Settings Changes**:
   - Update settings-reference.md
   - Update code examples in guides
   - Document breaking changes clearly

**Documentation Review Checklist:**

- [ ] README.md updated if user-facing change
- [ ] Relevant guides in `docs/` updated
- [ ] Code examples tested and current
- [ ] Settings documentation matches actual defaults
- [ ] No references to removed features
- [ ] Internal doc links not broken
      **Remember**: Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation. If you change code, you MUST update docs.

### Implementation Planning

When planning new features:

1. **Create detailed implementation plans** for significant features
2. **Include plans directly in GitHub issues** rather than separate files
3. **Structure plans with**:
   - Architecture overview
   - Core components with code examples
   - Integration points
   - Testing strategy (unit and integration tests)
   - Migration considerations
   - Timeline estimates

Example: See issue #90 for the custom prompt system implementation plan.

This keeps technical planning centralized and accessible for all contributors.

### Autonomous issue pipeline (auto-dev)

The **auto-dev** skill (from the maintainerd plugin, configured via `.claude/maintainerd.json`) runs one tick of an unattended issue-to-PR pipeline: it triages open issues for readiness (asking clarifying questions where needed), posts implementation plans for maintainer approval, builds the oldest approved issue into a PR, and addresses CodeRabbit/human review feedback on the open automated PR. When CodeRabbit is rate-limited and a ready, CI-green automated PR has sat past the review window (`autoDev.fallbackReviewMinutes`, default 60) with no review activity at all, a tick posts its own fresh-eyes **fallback self-review** — fixing valid findings first, then summarizing in a marker comment with a `## Fallback review` heading — so the maintainer still gets a review signal; it is clearly labeled a self-review, capped at one per PR, and never a formal GitHub approval. It **never merges** — merging is always the maintainer's act — and it keeps at most `autoDev.maxPrsInFlight` automated PRs (default 6) in flight at once, all awaiting the maintainer's merge.

- State lives in the `auto:*` GitHub labels (`auto:needs-info`, `auto:planned`, `auto:ready`, `auto:in-progress`, `auto:parked`, `auto:skip`). Add `auto:skip` to any issue the pipeline should never touch; add `auto:ready` to approve a posted plan directly (an approving reply on the plan comment also works); add `auto:parked` (or reply "park it" to a park proposal) to hold an issue you're still thinking about — the pipeline leaves a parked issue alone until you remove the label or add a new comment. The pipeline builds approved (`auto:ready`) issues ahead of grooming the backlog, so a greenlit plan never waits behind triage.
- Comments posted by the pipeline run under the maintainer's own GitHub account and are identified by a hidden `<!-- auto-dev -->` marker — that marker, not authorship, distinguishes automated comments from human ones.
- Scheduled runs are driven by a **recurring scheduled task (in the cloud) that invokes the skill directly** (`/auto-dev`) each tick — there is no local runner script or permissions allowlist. Each run gets a fresh, disposable full-toolchain sandbox (git, Node, `gh` authed as the maintainer); the skill owns its own setup (Step 0 puts the sandbox on a clean `master` and installs deps) and the tick's exit report is the run's summary output. The safety that the old allowlist enforced now lives in the skill's invariants (the **self-enforced hard prohibitions** in invariant 5: never merge/close, force-push, push to master, release, touch non-`auto:*` labels, or run destructive shell). Set the schedule's cadence comfortably longer than a typical build tick — there is no lockfile, so the task must not overlap its own runs (the `auto:*` label state machine, the in-flight cap (`autoDev.maxPrsInFlight`), and Step 1's orphan age-gate are the backstop).

#### Driving the maintainer side from a Claude Code session

The maintainer's half of the pipeline (reviewing plans, approving, answering questions) is usually done through an interactive Claude Code session. The **review-queue** skill (from the maintainerd plugin, invoked as `/review-queue` or "review the pipeline") packages this whole flow into a guided loop: it surfaces everything blocked on you (open PR, plans, questions, parked, new issues) as a one-line worklist, you reply with an issue/PR number and your decision, and it executes that against the `auto:*` labels **as you** (never with the marker), looping until the queue is drained. It never merges on its own and never builds. The steps below are what that skill automates, and what to do when driving the maintainer side by hand. When asked to "review the pipeline", "check what auto-dev is waiting on", "approve the plan on #N", or similar:

- **See the pipeline state**: `gh issue list --label "auto:planned"` (plans awaiting approval), `--label "auto:needs-info"` (questions/park proposals awaiting answers), `--label "auto:ready"` (build queue), `--label "auto:in-progress"` (being built), `--label "auto:parked"` (issues you've chosen to hold), plus `gh pr list --state open` filtered to `auto/` branches for the PR(s) in flight. Pipeline comments are the ones starting with the hidden `<!-- auto-dev -->` marker; third-party bot comments (`coderabbitai`, `dependabot`, …) are ignored for state decisions; everything else is human input.
- **Approve a plan**: reply on the issue with an explicit approval ("Approved.", optionally with amendments — "Approved, but use X instead of Y" counts and the pipeline incorporates the change), or add the `auto:ready` label directly. **Request changes**: reply with the changes; the next tick revises the plan. **Answer questions** on `auto:needs-info` issues with an ordinary comment; the next tick incorporates it.
- **Never include the `<!-- auto-dev -->` marker in comments posted on the maintainer's behalf.** The pipeline classifies marker comments as its own output — a marked reply would be invisible to it as human input. Don't imitate the pipeline's comment templates either.
- **Taking an issue over manually**: before implementing an issue yourself that carries `auto:planned`/`auto:ready` (or answering its plan with "I'll do this one"), add `auto:skip` (or at minimum remove `auto:ready`) so a scheduled tick doesn't build it concurrently. Remove `auto:skip` later to hand it back.
- **Reviewing the automated PR** works like any PR review: comment on the PR; the next tick addresses the feedback and replies. A PR whose only review is the pipeline's fallback self-review (marker comment with a `## Fallback review` heading) has had no independent eyes on it — give it a closer look before merging. Merging is always the human's call — the pipeline never merges, and a merge is what unblocks the next build.
- **Testing / manual ticks**: `/auto-dev dry-run` prints what a tick would do with zero side effects; `/auto-dev` runs one live tick interactively under normal permission prompts.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

For creating pull requests, use the **create-pr** skill which enforces the PR template and runs all pre-flight checks.

- Write concise, imperative commit subjects (`Fix agent session cleanup`, `Improve prompt builder`); reference issues/PRs with `#123`
- Commit generated artifacts (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `versions.json`) alongside source changes; use `npm run version` for releases
- **MANDATORY**: Include documentation updates in the same PR/commit as code changes (see Documentation Maintenance section)
- PRs should explain motivation, highlight user-visible impact, list automated/manual tests, and attach screenshots or vault clips for UI tweaks
- Flag reviewers who own the affected area and mention required follow-up or rollout notes
- PR descriptions should explicitly list which documentation files were updated

## UI/UX Best Practices

For UI/UX guidelines, use the **ui-ux-guidelines** skill.

### Design system

The plugin has a theme-adaptive **design token layer** at the top of `styles.css`
(`body { --gs-* }`) — semantic tokens aliasing Obsidian's theme variables, plus
plugin-owned spacing / radius / icon / motion scales and one Gemini brand accent.
When writing or modifying UI styles, **consume these tokens** rather than hardcoding
color or reaching for raw `var(--obsidian-var)` / magic numbers; keep the plugin
theme-adaptive. Icons are Lucide via `setIcon()`, sized from `--gs-icon-*` (`lg` =
18px is the default for toolbar/action icons — one size per context). The full
reference and token table live in
[docs/contributing/design-system.md](docs/contributing/design-system.md); every
surface is now on the tokens (with a few intentional raw-var holdouts). When making
a value-preserving CSS/token change,
**verify no computed-value change in a live vault** (`obsidian eval` +
`getComputedStyle`, or token-resolution equality) rather than eyeballing — that
catches token mis-maps and theme-scope bugs a screenshot won't.

## Security & Configuration

- Never commit API keys or vault data; keep secrets in local Obsidian configuration
- Document new network calls or permissions in `docs/` when adding features or capabilities
- Always use native Obsidian API calls when possible. Documentation here: https://docs.obsidian.md/Home
